Hello,
I would like to run ssGSEA in RNASeq data from the  CCLE repository.  

In this thread https://groups.google.com/g/genepattern-help/c/vcg9gLolZAY , 
it is recommended to use the PreprocessReadCounts module to process raw 
counts and then directly use ssGSEA. I found that the PreprocessReadCounts 
is now renamed as VoomNormalize but this module does not provide TPMs or 
accounts for gene length issues that influence ssGSEA performance. 
Nonetheless, it accounts for intersample variability, which is ignored in 
TPM units. 
In a more recent thread, 
https://groups.google.com/g/genepattern-help/c/pVvpxGOkiZU/m/Vsjrn-p6DQAJ , 
it is recommended to use TPM units as input to ssGSEA. 

My questions:
1) Should I use the VoomNormalize results or the TPM values as input to 
ssGSEA?

2) If I use TPM units, how should I remove the inter-sample variability? 
Which sample normalization method, from the 3 options (rank, rank.log or 
log), would be best? 

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

S.

Subject: SNPFileCreator & Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array data

Hi,

I am new to CEL files. 

I would like to create SNP files from CEL files generated by Affymetrix 
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, but the SNPFileCreator module only 
allows four types of Affymetrix arrays (50K Hind, 50K Xba, 250K Sty, and 
250K NSP). 

Is it still possible to use SNPFileCreator on Affymetrix Human Genome U133

Thank you,

Subject: new to RNAseq advanced analysis and Gene pattern comparative module

My colleague and I produced bulk RNAseq on four different cell types based 
on the expression of two genes in diseased mice model 3-month and 6-month 
time points. I was looking for a tool that can give us more comparative 
analysis than the simple heatmap we got. We know each gene expression level 
in each column, and overall, it is either up or down in older mice after 
running DESEQ2. The Excel spreadsheet example he gave me with results from 
the DGE analysis is enclosed. How can I change this file? I have to fit the 
comparative analysis module. Is there any other module or tool that helps 
us decipher the difference between cell types from bulk RNAseq? We are 
looking for a block of signatures or a more exclusive gene list specific to 
a type or be prominent in one or two cell types not the others
Thanks!

Subject: Sharing data files in Genepattern repository?

GenePattern Notebook files can be shared easily among users logged into the 
same GenePattern Notebook server.  

We need a way to store and share small (< 5 MB) with our GenePattern 
Notebooks.  

Is there an easy way (ala a "Share Data" button) to share data files on the 
Genepattern Jupyter Notebook server?  

I understand that storage costs and data security can be a problem and 
perhaps that is why it is not included.  

If built-in data file sharing was intentionally left out by design, what is 
the recommended way to securely store and share files from within 
GenePattern Notebook client notebook?  

Having a GPNB built-in module to browse and manage a *secure* data file 
store in a secure way would facilitate having all work artifacts in-place 
and reduce the cognitive load on users.  

A "Data Library" tab and embedded website page similar to the Notebook 
Library page would accomplish this.  The Data Library could have the same "Public 
Datasets", "Shared Datasets" interface on the left-side navigator and the 
table of file metadata on the main page body.   

Has anyone implemented a built-in Data (Sharing) Library for data files?  

Thank you.

Subject: RANK normalization



I use RankNormalize (Version 1.9) to normalize mRNAseq and miRNAseq data

I downloaded files from TCGA database.

Some values are NA(I think Not assessed).

For the first time, I did RankNormalization without change.

After processiong, I look at value which was NA and there was some 
change(NA-> some values)

I think that excluding this data is best way.

Do you have any suggestions???

I noticed very suspicious regions appeared in lesion file which are not at

Chr1:1-...... but gistic regions are giving it as chr1:1-25962889(probes

Subject: GSEA with NanoString data

Hello, 

I have been reading your blog with interest and came across a problem, 
which I still cannot solve yet. We have performed a nanostring analysis in 
T cells from two groups of tumor patients looking on around 600 genes. Now 
we are wondering if it is valid to perform a pathway analysis within this 
gene set using GSEA.

As I have understood so far, GSEA was initially designed for the analysis 
of microarray and mRNA seq data, where the gene sets are much bigger than 
in a nanstring analysis. Now in one of your comments, you posted that the 
gene set used by nanostring analysis is too small and therefore using GSEA 
is not valid in this case. However, another comment stated, that when 
adjusting the reference gene list to your used gene list, it would be 
possible to perform GSEA. To further explain our data, we are comparing two 
patient groups with each other and have a healthy donor control, for all 
groups the same gene set was analysed, we have calculated the t-statistics/ 
log-fold change with the Software nanostring provided. Furthermore we were 
wondering whether it would be an additional benefit to rather use a 
preranked gene list for the analysis.

Many thanks for your help in advance!

Subject: Inconsistent results with GSEA

Hi. I am writing because I found a slightly inconsistent reporting of the 
results in two GSEA runs I made through the GENEPATTERN suite 
(https://cloud.genepattern.org/).

The first run was done on November 6, 2019 using the MsigDB 7.0
The second run was done today using the MsigDB v7.1.

In the enclosed two png files where you can see that the reported figures 
of ES, NES, etc., are slightly different. I was wondering if this lack of 
reproducibility is due do the fact that I did something different, besided 
using two different MSigDB versions. I apologize in advance if I am missing 
something big here.

I enclose also the rpt files of both runs.  

Thanks in advance.

The command ran was in that case:

I defined the -cp to point to the Qualimap jar and lib folder containing the other jars. This is enough under terminal to get it to work.


How can I fix this error requiring starting X11 env (if possible?)

Subject: ssGSEA Nanostring input expression data

Hello,

I would like to use ssGSEA for my Nanostring project (800 targeted genes,

input expression data.

I am currently using the DESeq2-based workflow as suggested in this article 
<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.032490v3>, and am

data? I understand there has been discussion 
<https://groups.google.com/g/genepattern-help/c/pVvpxGOkiZU> on appropriate 
input data for RNAseq, but I figured Nanostring would be different as it 
uses housekeeping genes for normalization, and the concept of TPM or FPKM 
does not apply to Nanostring per my understanding.

Subject: Input format for ABSOLUTE using sequencing data



Hello,

Can anyone explain how to use ABSOLUTE for cancer DNA sequencing data? I
searched for
http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/absolute_run 

But did not find enough information. Specifically, ABSOLUTE requires the
input data to have at least four columns:
"Chromosome", "Start", "End", "Num_Probes" and "Segment_Mean".


For my sequencing data, I have done the segmentation already, and I have
"Chromosome", "Start", "End", plus the number of reads mapped to the
segment in tumor sample "d_T", and the number of reads mapped to the
segment in matched normal sample "d_N". So, I'm wondering how to convert
these "d_N", "d_T" into "Num_Probes" and "Segment_Mean" for ABSOLUTE?

Thanks so much!

1) and 12 tumor values (2.3, 3.4, 5.6, etc). Although, I had a reasonable 
luck by performing a pre-ranked GSEA, in which I made an arbitrary +2/-2 
fold change cutoff, I feel I am not using all the info I have at disposal. 
In particular, bedides using the arbitrary fold change cutoff, I am not 
considering the variability of the the tumor samples data. So, in order to 
overcome these problems, I was thinking about two alternative ways to run 
GSEA:
a) use 1 control (with a value of 1 for each gene) vs. the actual fold 
change values of all the 12 tumor samples
b) 
- generate, for each gene, 12 control values with both a mean of 1 and the 
same standard deviation of the corresponding tumor samples
- perform a 12 vs. 12 GSEA, using the newly generated control value vs. the 
12 tumor sample values (the same  I used in a). 
I was wondering if you could advice me on which one, if any, would be the 
best way to proceed.

Thank you!

Subject: Help running ABSOLUTE in GenePattern

Please respond with the following information as applicable:
 Complete description of the problem (ie what you were trying to do and 
what went wrong): 

Hello, I am trying to run the ABSOLUTE module in GenePattern, but cannot 
seem to get off the ground. It looks like the basic version of module is 
not on public server, and I cannot seem to install the local version of 
GenePattern on my home laptop. I think the latter issue may be due 
to incompatibility with my MacOS version (High Sierra version 10.13.6). I 
also cannot seem to run ABSOLUTE directly from R on my laptop, as the 
version of R is apparently needs is pretty old and can't install on my 
macOS either. Am I really boxed in here, or do you have any thoughts on how 
I can get this software to work?

Any help or guidance you could offer would be greatly appreciated,

Subject: HeatMapImage color scale legend

Hi,

I would like to use a heatmap generated from HeatMapImage v6, however, it 
is not immediately clear to me how to make a legend for the color scale. 
Under row normalization is each row max/min set independently for 
individual rows or is there a universal scale?

Subject: Does GISTIC look for genes or cytobands?

Hello all

I am currently working with TCGA-LIHC CNV data which has been processed on 
GISTIC, and have not used it myself. On the cBioPortal, there are lists of 
genes which were considered as amplified, normal or deleted for each 
sample, along with a cytoband of the gene. I would like to know how the 
gene name is determined exactly. Does the pipeline look for 
amplifications/deletions of *each gen*e specifically *or each cytoband* -and 
then considers everygene in a cytoband as amplified/deleted?
