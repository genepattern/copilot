STAR.indexer is on version 1.
A description of STAR.indexer is The STAR indexer makes from a series of fastA files containing a genome an index for use with the STAR spliced read to genome aligner. It can optionally (but highly recommended !) incorporate information about known intron-exon junctions..
STAR.indexer is a GenePattern module written by Guy Bottu, V.I.B.-B.I.T.S..
STAR.indexer can be categorized as Genomics, RNA-Seq, Alignment.
STAR.indexer has the following parameters: input fasta file, GTF file, tab file, index dir, overhang, index string length, bin size, RAM limit.
STAR.indexer is a GenePattern module used to create an index for the STAR RNA-seq alignment software.
The STAR.indexer prepares genomic sequence data for rapid and accurate spliced read alignment.
STAR.indexer takes one or more FASTA files containing genomic sequences as its primary input.
The module can incorporate additional information about gene models and splice junctions through optional GTF or tab-separated files.
STAR.indexer allows customization of indexing parameters like overhang length, index string length, and RAM allocation.
The module generates a compressed index directory that can be directly used by the STAR.aligner for mapping RNA-seq reads.
STAR.indexer is particularly useful for preparing large and complex genomic datasets for high-throughput sequencing analysis.
The indexing process optimizes computational efficiency by creating a pre-computed reference for rapid alignment.
Researchers can use STAR.indexer to prepare indices for various organisms and genomic assemblies.
The module supports both small and large genomes, with flexible parameter settings to accommodate different computational resources.
STAR.indexer is part of the broader STAR alignment ecosystem developed by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
The module helps improve the accuracy of splice junction mapping by incorporating known gene model annotations.
Bioinformaticians can use STAR.indexer as a critical preprocessing step in RNA-seq data analysis pipelines.
input_files: file type, STAR.indexer requires one or more fastA files containing genome sequences, required parameter for genome indexing
GTF_file: file type, optional GTF file with gene model annotations to improve splice junction mapping accuracy, can enhance STAR aligner performance
tab_file: file type, optional tab-separated file with gene model annotations, can be used instead of or alongside GTF file, typically generated by previous STAR aligner run
index_dir: string type, name of directory and ZIP file for storing STAR index, required parameter for organizing index output
overhang: integer type, length of genomic sequence around intron-exon junctions, recommended to be max(ReadLength) - 1, default is 100
index_string_length: integer type, length of strings used for index creation, recommended to scale down for small genomes, default is 14
bin_size: integer type, size of storage bins for genome indexing, can be reduced for genomes with many scaffolds, default is 18
RAM_limit: integer type, upper limit of RAM allocated for indexing process in gigabytes, may need adjustment for large genomes, default is 31
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the STAR.indexer module:
Input genome fasta file contains DNA sequences of a genome in standard fasta format with chromosome/scaffold sequences
Input GTF file contains gene model annotations with exon coordinates and transcript identifiers in GTF or GFF3 format
Input tab file contains splice junction information with chromosome, intron coordinates, strand, and junction details in tab-separated format
Input files must have chromosome names matching exactly between genome fasta and annotation files
Output STAR index is a compressed ZIP archive containing multiple binary index files for genome alignment
Output index files enable rapid genomic alignment by precomputing genome mapping information
Output ZIP archive can be directly used as input for STAR alignment module
Genome fasta input files must contain complete chromosome/scaffold sequences for entire reference genome
GTF annotation file helps improve splice junction mapping accuracy during genome alignment
Tab junction file can be generated from previous STAR alignment runs to provide additional splice site information
STAR index files are optimized for fast memory-efficient genomic read mapping
STAR.indexer is a GenePattern module for creating an index from genome sequences for the STAR RNA-seq alignment tool.
The STAR.indexer module requires input genome sequences in FASTA format.
STAR.indexer can incorporate gene model annotations from GTF or tab-separated files to improve splice junction mapping accuracy.
The module allows customization of indexing parameters like overhang length, index string length, and RAM allocation.
Chromosome/scaffold names in annotation files must exactly match those in the genome FASTA files.
The module generates a ZIP archive containing the STAR index files, which can be used directly by the STAR aligner.
Annotation files can include information about intron-exon boundaries, strand orientation, and splice junction types.
The recommended overhang length is typically the read length minus one, with 100 being a good generic value.
STAR.indexer supports both small and large genomes by allowing flexible index string and bin size configurations.
The module is based on the STAR aligner developed by Alexander Dobin at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
