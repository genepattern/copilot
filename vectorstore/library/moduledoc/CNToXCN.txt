CNToXCN is on version v.1.
A description of CNToXCN is Converts a CN file to an XCN file. This module converts a CN file (a tab-delimited file format that contains SNP copy numbers) to an XCN file (a tab-delimited file format that contains SNP copy numbers and also Call information)..
CNToXCN is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Team, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
CNToXCN can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
CNToXCN has the following parameters: cn file, output prefix.
The CNToXCN GenePattern module is a specialized tool for converting copy number data files in genomic research.
The CNToXCN module transforms CN files into XCN files, adding additional genomic annotation information during the conversion process.
This module is particularly useful in SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) analysis workflows within bioinformatics research.
The CNToXCN module requires two primary input parameters: a source CN file and an output file prefix for the resulting XCN file.
The module generates an output file with a ".nocalls.xcn" extension, which contains expanded copy number data with potential additional genomic context.
The CNToXCN module is platform-independent, capable of running on any operating system and CPU architecture.
Written in Perl, the CNToXCN module provides a standardized method for genomic data file transformation in research settings.
The module is designed to support researchers working with copy number variation (CNV) data, facilitating data format interoperability.
Researchers can use the CNToXCN module to prepare genomic data for downstream analysis in various bioinformatics pipelines.
The module's simple conversion process makes it accessible to researchers with intermediate computational biology skills.
