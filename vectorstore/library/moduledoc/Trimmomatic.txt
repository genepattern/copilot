Trimmomatic is on version 2 BETA.
A description of Trimmomatic is Provides a variety of options for trimming Illumina FASTQ files of adapter sequences and low-quality reads. The module conducts quality-based trimming and filtering of FASTQ-formatted short read data produced by Illumina sequencers..
Trimmomatic is a GenePattern module written by Anthony Bolger et al, Usadel Lab, Rheinsch - Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen.
Trimmomatic can be categorized as RNA-seq, Sequencing, Trimming, Quality Control.
Trimmomatic has the following parameters: input file 1, input file 2, output filename base, adapter clip sequence file, phred encoding.
The Trimmomatic GenePattern module is a powerful tool for preprocessing high-throughput sequencing data from Illumina platforms.
Trimmomatic helps researchers clean and filter raw sequencing reads by removing low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
The Trimmomatic module supports both single-end and paired-end sequencing data processing.
Trimmomatic can detect and remove Illumina adapter sequences using two primary modes: simple mode and palindrome mode.
The module provides multiple trimming operations including adapter clipping, leading and trailing quality trimming, and read length filtering.
Trimmomatic's max.info operation performs adaptive quality trimming, balancing read length retention with error reduction.
The sliding.window operation allows quality-based trimming by evaluating average base quality within a specified window.
Researchers can use Trimmomatic to improve downstream analysis by removing sequencing artifacts and low-quality regions from reads.
The module supports different phred quality score encodings, with phred33 being the default for modern Illumina sequencing platforms.
Trimmomatic can help increase the accuracy of subsequent bioinformatics analyses like RNA-seq alignment, assembly, and variant calling.
The GenePattern implementation of Trimmomatic provides a user-friendly interface for performing complex read preprocessing tasks.
Advanced users can leverage the extra.steps parameter to access additional trimming operations not directly exposed in the module's interface.
Trimmomatic is particularly useful for preparing RNA-seq data by removing technical sequences and low-quality bases before alignment.
The module automatically handles compressed input files, supporting both gzip and bzip2 compression formats.
Researchers can customize trimming parameters to suit different sequencing applications, from strict alignment to more tolerant assembly approaches.

Trimmomatic input file 1 is a FASTQ file containing raw sequencing reads from an Illumina sequencer.
Trimmomatic input file 2 is an optional FASTQ file containing the reverse reads for paired-end sequencing data.
Trimmomatic adapter clip sequence file is a FASTA file containing adapter sequences to be removed from reads.
Trimmomatic input files can be compressed with gzip or bzip2 and will be automatically detected.
Trimmomatic output paired-end files include _1P.fq and _2P.fq for reads where both pairs survived trimming.
Trimmomatic output unpaired files include _1U.fq and _2U.fq for reads where only one read in a pair survived.
Trimmomatic single-end output file is a -trimmed.fq file containing surviving reads.
Trimmomatic trimlog output file contains detailed information about trimming operations performed on each read.
Trimmomatic cmdline.log file shows the equivalent command-line Trimmomatic call used by the module.
Trimmomatic supports both phred33 and phred64 quality score encodings for input FASTQ files.
Trimmomatic is a GenePattern module for quality-based trimming and filtering of Illumina FASTQ sequencing data.
Trimmomatic can process both single-end and paired-end sequencing reads with multiple quality control operations.
The Trimmomatic module supports six primary trimming operations that can be applied in a predefined order.
Adapter clipping is the first operation, designed to remove technical sequences like Illumina adapters from sequencing reads.
The trim.leading operation removes low-quality bases from the beginning of reads based on a specified quality threshold.
The trim.trailing operation removes low-quality bases from the end of reads based on a specified quality threshold.
The max.info operation performs adaptive quality trimming, balancing read length retention against error probability.
The sliding.window operation trims reads by calculating the average quality within a specified window size.
The min.read.length operation removes reads that fall below a specified minimum length threshold.
Trimmomatic supports phred33 and phred64 quality score encodings, with phred33 being the default for modern Illumina sequencing.
For paired-end data, Trimmomatic can detect adapter read-through using a sophisticated "palindrome mode" alignment strategy.
The module allows advanced users to specify additional trimming steps through the extra.steps parameter.
Trimmomatic is particularly useful for preprocessing RNA-seq data before alignment or assembly.
The module can help improve downstream analysis by removing low-quality bases, adapter sequences, and short reads.
