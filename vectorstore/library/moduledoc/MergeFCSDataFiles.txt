MergeFCSDataFiles is on version 1.
A description of MergeFCSDataFiles is Merge multiple Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files into a single FCS dataset; includes sub-sampling option..
MergeFCSDataFiles is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
MergeFCSDataFiles can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
MergeFCSDataFiles has the following parameters: Input.files, Subsampling.rate, Keep.n.events, Random.seed, Output.file.name.
The MergeFCSDataFiles GenePattern module allows researchers to combine multiple flow cytometry data files into a single comprehensive dataset.
The MergeFCSDataFiles module enables merging multiple FCS files containing cellular measurement data from flow cytometry experiments.
This module is particularly useful for researchers wanting to analyze flow cytometry data across multiple samples or patients in a unified manner.
The MergeFCSDataFiles module can subsample events from input files, allowing researchers to randomly select a specified percentage or number of events from each dataset.
When using MergeFCSDataFiles, all input FCS files must have consistent parameter measurements to ensure data compatibility and meaningful merging.
The MergeFCSDataFiles module requires input files to be provided as a zip file, directory pointer, or text file listing full file paths.
Researchers can control event selection in the MergeFCSDataFiles module by specifying either a subsampling rate or a fixed number of events to retain from each input file.
The MergeFCSDataFiles module is designed to handle large flow cytometry datasets, with demonstrated performance on files containing up to 102 input files with 10,000-38,000 events each.
By using the MergeFCSDataFiles module, scientists can consolidate flow cytometry data for more comprehensive population analysis and clustering studies.
The MergeFCSDataFiles module supports standard FCS 3.1 file format, ensuring compatibility with modern flow cytometry data standards.
Input.files, file path, MergeFCSDataFiles module requires input FCS files to merge, specifies source files via zip, directory, or text file listing, required parameter
Subsampling.rate, numeric, MergeFCSDataFiles module controls percentage of events included from each dataset, ranges from 0-100, default is 100%, mutually exclusive with Keep.n.events
Keep.n.events, numeric, MergeFCSDataFiles module specifies approximate number of events to retain from each dataset, mutually exclusive with Subsampling.rate, optional parameter
Random.seed, numeric, MergeFCSDataFiles module sets random number generator seed for event selection, default value is 1234567, controls reproducibility of random sampling
Output.file.name, string, MergeFCSDataFiles module defines name of merged output FCS file, default is MergedFCSDataFiles.fcs, optional parameter for specifying output filename
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the MergeFCSDataFiles module:
Input files for MergeFCSDataFiles module are FCS data files containing flow cytometry measurements.
FCS files are binary files storing multi-parameter cellular measurement data from flow cytometry experiments.
Input files can be provided as a zip archive, directory pointer, or text file listing full file paths.
Input FCS files must have consistent parameter definitions across all files being merged.
Input files typically contain cellular measurement data with 7-13 parameters per file.
Input files usually range from 10,000-70,000 cellular events per file.
Output file for MergeFCSDataFiles module is a single merged FCS data file.
Merged FCS file contains events from all input files, potentially subsampled based on user parameters.
Output file preserves original parameter definitions from input files.
Output file name defaults to MergedFCSDataFiles.fcs if not specified by user.
Output file size can be significantly larger than input files depending on number of merged datasets.
Output FCS file follows FCS 3.1 standard for flow cytometry data file formatting.
Here are the chunks for the MergeFCSDataFiles module documentation:
MergeFCSDataFiles is a GenePattern module for combining multiple Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files into a single dataset.
The module allows merging events from multiple FCS files that contain the same parameters.
MergeFCSDataFiles can be useful for clustering and analyzing flow cytometry data across multiple patient samples.
The module verifies parameter consistency across input files by checking parameter short names.
Users can specify a subsampling rate to randomly select a percentage of events from each input dataset.
Alternatively, users can specify a fixed number of events to include from each input dataset.
By default, if no subsampling options are selected, all events from all input files are included in the merged output.
The module requires input files to be provided as a zip file, directory pointer, or text file with full file paths.
MergeFCSDataFiles supports merging large numbers of FCS files, with example use cases of 48-102 files processed.
The module is platform-independent and requires Java 1.6 or higher to run.
Output is a single FCS file containing events from the input datasets, with optional subsampling.
The random seed can be specified to ensure reproducibility of event selection.
The module was developed by Josef Spidlen and is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry analysis toolkit.
