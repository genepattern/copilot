IlluminaExpressionFileCreator is on version .
A description of IlluminaExpressionFileCreator is Creates GCT files from a set of Illumina expression IDAT files. The module converts raw Illumina BeadArray data to the GenePattern GCT file format by extracting the mean value for each probe from a set of Illumina expression IDAT files supplied in a single ZIP archive..
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator is a GenePattern module written by David Eby (contacts: Chris Williams, Ted Liefeld), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator has the following parameters: idat zip, manifest custom manifest, output file, background subtraction mode, collapse mode, chip custom chip, clm.
The IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module converts raw Illumina BeadArray data to the GenePattern GCT file format.
The IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module extracts mean values for gene and control probes from Illumina expression IDAT files.
The module requires a ZIP archive of IDAT files and an Illumina annotation manifest file as mandatory inputs.
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator can optionally perform background subtraction by removing the mean of negative control signal values from probe values.
The module offers multiple probe collapsing strategies: no collapse, maximum value per gene, or median value per gene.
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator can use an optional CHIP file to map probes to gene names for more precise data representation.
The module generates two primary output files: a GCT file for gene probes and another for control probes.
An optional CLM file allows users to specify custom sample names and control which IDAT files are processed.
IlluminaExpressionFileCreator supports multiple Illumina array types and can handle different versions of BeadStudio and GenomeStudio.
The module is designed to be platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system with Java support.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the parameters for the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module:
idat zip (File, Required): ZIP archive containing Illumina expression IDAT files of the same array type.
manifest (File, Required): Illumina annotation manifest file in tab-delimited TXT format for the IDAT files.
output file (File, Required): Specifies the base name for output GCT files for gene and control probes.
background subtraction mode (Boolean, Optional, Default=false): Option to subtract background noise by removing mean of negative control signal values.
collapse mode (String, Optional, Default="none"): Determines how multiple probe values for a gene are consolidated (options: "none", "max", "median").
chip (File, Optional): CHIP file mapping probes to gene names, used for probe collapsing and description lookup.
clm (File, Optional): CLM file mapping IDAT file names to sample names, controlling sample inclusion and order in output files.
Here are the input and output files described in atomic, semantically distinct chunks:
IDAT ZIP archive contains raw Illumina BeadArray expression data files of the same array type.
Illumina manifest file in tab-delimited TXT format provides annotation information for the IDAT files.
CHIP file optionally maps probes to gene names, with files available from the module or uploadable.
CLM file optionally maps IDAT file names to sample names, controlling which samples are included in output.
Gene probe GCT output file contains expression values for gene probes, named with base input file name.
Control probe GCT output file contains expression values for control probes, named with base input file name plus "-controls".
Optional CLS file generated when CLM file contains class names, providing class information for further analysis.
IDAT files are raw binary files containing Illumina microarray expression data measurements.
Manifest file is a tab-delimited text file with probe and array annotation details from Illumina.
CHIP file maps probe identifiers to gene names and descriptions in a specific GenePattern format.
CLM file is a text file specifying IDAT file names and corresponding sample names for processing.
GCT output files are tab-delimited text files containing gene expression measurements in GenePattern format.
CLS file is a text file containing sample class information for downstream analysis in GenePattern modules.
Here are the chunks for the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module documentation:
The IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module converts raw Illumina BeadArray data to the GenePattern GCT file format.
The module extracts mean probe values from Illumina expression IDAT files contained in a single ZIP archive.
Two GCT files are created: one for gene probes and another for control probes in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module.
Optionally, the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module can collapse probe results to a single value per gene for each sample.
The module requires a ZIP archive of Illumina IDAT files of the same array type for the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator process.
An array annotation manifest file corresponding to the IDAT files is required for the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module.
Background subtraction can be performed in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator by calculating the mean of negative control signal values.
The IlluminaExpressionFileCreator offers three collapse modes: none (default), max, and median for handling multiple probes per gene.
A CHIP file can be optionally provided to map probes to gene names in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator module.
A CLM file can specify sample names and control which IDAT files are processed in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator.
The module generates two primary output files: a gene probe GCT file and a control probe GCT file in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator.
An optional CLS file can be generated if a CLM file with class information is provided in the IlluminaExpressionFileCreator.
The IlluminaExpressionFileCreator is compatible with any CPU and operating system, implemented in Java.
