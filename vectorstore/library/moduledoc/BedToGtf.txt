BedToGtf is on version .
A description of BedToGtf is Converts a BED file to GTF or GFF format. BED format is used to define genome annotations and genomic regions. It contains 3 required fields: the name of the chromosome, the starting position of the feature on the chromosome, and the end position of the feature..
BedToGtf is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire and Boel Brynedal, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
BedToGtf can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
BedToGtf has the following parameters: bed.file, output.format, output.prefix.
The BedToGtf module converts genomic coordinate files between different annotation formats for bioinformatics analysis.
The BedToGtf module allows researchers to transform BED files into standardized genomic annotation formats like GTF and GFF.
BED files contain basic genomic region information including chromosome name, start position, and end position for genomic features.
The BedToGtf module requires input BED files with at least 12 columns to generate a complete GTF file conversion.
Researchers use the BedToGtf module to standardize genomic annotation data across different bioinformatics tools and platforms.
The BedToGtf module supports conversion to two primary genomic annotation formats: GTF (Gene Transfer Format) and GFF (General Feature Format).
Genomic researchers utilize the BedToGtf module to prepare annotation data for downstream analyses like gene expression studies and genome mapping.
The BedToGtf module preserves all original information from the input BED file during the format conversion process.
Bioinformaticians can use the BedToGtf module to ensure compatibility between different genomic data processing and visualization tools.
The BedToGtf module is platform-independent and requires only Java 1.5 or higher to execute, making it widely accessible.
bed.file | File | BedToGtf module requires input BED file with at least 12 columns for GTF file creation | Required | No default value
output.format | String | Specifies output file format as either GTF or GFF in BedToGtf module | Required | No default value
output.prefix | String | Defines prefix for output filename in BedToGtf module | Required | Default is input bed file basename

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the BedToGtf module:
BedToGtf module requires a BED format input file with genomic feature annotations
Input BED file contains chromosome name, start position, end position, and optional additional fields
Input BED file needs at least 12 columns to generate a complete GTF file
BedToGtf module output is a converted GTF or GFF format file
Output GTF/GFF file contains transformed genomic feature information from the input BED file
Output file format determined by user-specified output.format parameter
Output file name uses user-defined output.prefix or defaults to input file basename
GTF format includes detailed genomic feature descriptions with start, end, and frame information
GFF format provides similar genomic feature annotations with standardized structural details
BedToGtf conversion preserves original genomic feature information during format transformation
BedToGtf is a computational genomics module that converts genomic annotation files between different formats.
The BedToGtf module transforms BED files, which define genomic regions and annotations, into GTF or GFF formats.
BED files contain essential genomic location information including chromosome name, start position, and end position.
BED files can include up to 12 columns of data, with optional fields like feature name, score, strand, and exon information.
The module supports conversion to GTF (Gene Transfer Format) and GFF (General Feature Format), which provide detailed sequence feature descriptions.
BedToGtf requires an input BED file with at least 12 columns to successfully generate a GTF file.
Users must specify the desired output format (GTF or GFF) and provide an output file name prefix.
The conversion process is based on the BED to GFF converter from Galaxy Tools, a well-established bioinformatics platform.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system with Java version 1.5 or higher.
This module is classified as a preprocessing and utility tool for genomic data manipulation.
The output file preserves all original BED file information in the newly specified format.
