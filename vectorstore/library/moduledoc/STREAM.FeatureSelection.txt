STREAM.FeatureSelection is on version .
A description of STREAM.FeatureSelection is STREAM (Single-cell Trajectories Reconstruction, Exploration And Mapping) is an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. STREAM.FeatureSelection is used to identify features to be used in the downstream analysis..
STREAM.FeatureSelection is a GenePattern module written by Huidong Chen, Massachussets General Hospital, wrapped as a module by Ted Liefeld, Mesirov Lab, UCSD School of Medicine.
STREAM.FeatureSelection can be categorized as Single-cell Analysis, Feature Selection, RNA-seq.
STREAM.FeatureSelection has the following parameters: data file, output filename, find variable genes, loess fraction, percentile, num genes, find principal components, feature, num principal components, max principal components, first principal component, use precomputed, figure height, figure width.
The STREAM.FeatureSelection module helps identify key features in single-cell RNA sequencing data for downstream trajectory analysis.
STREAM.FeatureSelection allows researchers to select important genes or principal components from complex single-cell transcriptomic datasets.
The module uses two primary methods for feature selection: identifying variable genes or performing principal component analysis (PCA).
For variable gene selection, STREAM.FeatureSelection calculates the mean and standard deviation of gene expression across all cells in the dataset.
The module applies a non-parametric local regression method (LOESS) to determine which genes deviate significantly from the expected expression pattern.
STREAM.FeatureSelection can select variable genes based on different criteria like percentile ranking or a specified number of top genes.
As an alternative to variable gene selection, the module can perform PCA to identify the most informative principal components in the dataset.
The PCA approach allows researchers to reduce the dimensionality of single-cell data while preserving the most important sources of variation.
STREAM.FeatureSelection generates visualization plots to help researchers understand the gene selection or principal component analysis process.
The module is part of the broader STREAM pipeline for reconstructing and exploring complex single-cell trajectories in transcriptomic and epigenomic data.
STREAM.FeatureSelection is particularly useful for studying cellular differentiation, developmental processes, and dynamic cellular states.
The module is designed to work seamlessly within the GenePattern computational biology platform, facilitating advanced single-cell data analysis.
Researchers can customize the feature selection process by adjusting parameters like LOESS fraction, percentile thresholds, and number of components.
STREAM.FeatureSelection supports both hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches to identifying key molecular features in single-cell datasets.

STREAM.FeatureSelection is a GenePattern module for identifying key features in single-cell transcriptomic data for trajectory analysis.
The module helps researchers select informative genes or principal components from single-cell RNA-seq datasets.
STREAM.FeatureSelection can identify variable genes using a non-parametric local regression method called LOESS.
The variable gene selection method calculates mean and standard deviation values for each gene across all cells.
Genes that significantly diverge from the mean-standard deviation relationship are selected as potential features.
Alternatively, STREAM.FeatureSelection can perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select top informative components.
Users can specify the number of variable genes or principal components to retain for downstream trajectory analysis.
The module generates visualization plots showing the relationship between gene variability and the fitted curve.
STREAM.FeatureSelection is part of a comprehensive single-cell trajectory reconstruction pipeline called STREAM.
The module is designed to work with preprocessed single-cell RNA-seq data that has been normalized and log-transformed.
Researchers can customize feature selection by adjusting parameters like LOESS fraction, percentile, and number of components.
The output includes a pickle file with annotated feature-selected data and optional visualization plots.
STREAM.FeatureSelection supports both transcriptomic and epigenomic data exploration at the single-cell level.
The module is based on research published in Nature Communications, providing a robust computational approach to feature selection.
