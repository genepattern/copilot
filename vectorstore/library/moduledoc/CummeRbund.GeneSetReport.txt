CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is on version 1.
A description of CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is CummeRbund is a visualization package designed to help you navigate through Cuffdiff RNA-Seq differential expression analysis results. It allows visualization of RNA-Seq data by aggregating, indexing, and creating publication-ready figures. This specific module (GeneSetReport) allows focusing on a specific list of genes to be visualized..
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is a GenePattern module written by Loyal Goff, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport can be categorized as RNA-seq, Visualization, Differential Expression.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport has the following parameters: cuffdiff input, geneset file, selected condition, output format, feature level, report as aggregate, log transform.
The CummeRbund.GeneSetReport module is a specialized bioinformatics tool for visualizing RNA-seq differential expression data from Cuffdiff experiments.
The CummeRbund.GeneSetReport allows researchers to generate multiple visualization plots for a predefined set of genes from RNA-seq data.
This GenePattern module can create several types of graphical representations, including dendrograms, expression bar plots, expression line plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and volcano plots.
The CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is designed to work specifically with Cuffdiff output files, requiring the entire job folder as input rather than individual files.
Researchers can use the CummeRbund.GeneSetReport to examine gene expression patterns across different experimental conditions and samples.
The module allows users to specify a custom list of genes for focused visualization, making it useful for investigating specific gene sets of interest.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport can generate plots at different feature levels, including genes, isoforms, transcription start sites, and coding sequences.
The visualization outputs can help researchers identify patterns of gene expression, statistical significance, and fold changes between different experimental conditions.
This module is part of a collaborative effort between MIT's Computational Biology group and Harvard's Rinn Lab, focusing on advanced RNA-seq data analysis.
The CummeRbund.GeneSetReport requires R 2.15 and includes multiple supporting R packages for comprehensive data visualization and analysis.
Researchers can use the module to create publication-ready figures that illustrate complex RNA-seq expression data in an accessible and informative manner.
The module supports both aggregate sample analysis and individual replicate visualization, providing flexibility in data interpretation.
cuffdiff.input (File, Required): Input containing Cuffdiff job results, previous CummeRbund job, or cuffData.db database file for RNA-seq analysis visualization
geneset.file (File, Required): Text file listing genes to be analyzed, supporting gene symbols, gene IDs, isoform IDs, TSS group IDs, or CDS IDs for CummeRbund report generation
selected.condition (String, Optional): Comma-separated list of specific conditions/samples to include in plots, using names from original Cuffdiff job
output.format (String, Required): Specifies the output file format for CummeRbund visualization results
feature.level (String, Required): Determines the biological feature level for reporting (genes, isoforms, transcription start sites, or coding sequences)
report.as.aggregate (Boolean, Optional): Controls visualization of individual replicates versus aggregate condition values, defaulting to aggregate sample representation
log.transform (Boolean, Optional): Determines whether FPKM values should be log-transformed for visualization, affecting plot scaling and representation in CummeRbund analysis
Here are the input and output files for the CummeRbund.GeneSetReport module:
Input Files:
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport requires a Cuffdiff job folder containing all Cuffdiff output files
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport needs a text file with a list of genes, one gene per line
Genes can be represented by gene symbol, gene ID, isoform ID, TSS group ID, or CDS ID
Output Files:
cuffData.db is an RSQLite database created from the original Cuffdiff job
GeneSet.Dendrogram shows Jensen-Shannon distances between conditions for the gene list
GeneSet.ExpressionBarplot displays FPKM values with confidence intervals for the gene list
GeneSet.ExpressionPlot creates a line plot of FPKM values across samples
GeneSet.Heatmap generates a clustered heatmap of FPKM values for the gene list
GeneSet.Scatter produces pairwise scatter plots comparing FPKM values between samples
GeneSet.Volcano plots fold change and statistical significance for pairwise condition comparisons
stdout.txt and stderr.txt provide logs of the module's execution process
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is a GenePattern module for visualizing RNA-Seq differential expression data from Cuffdiff analysis.
The module helps researchers explore gene expression patterns across different experimental conditions using multiple visualization techniques.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport requires a complete Cuffdiff job output or a pre-generated database file as input.
Users must provide a text file containing a list of genes they want to analyze in the CummeRbund.GeneSetReport module.
The module can generate multiple types of visualizations, including dendrograms, expression bar plots, expression line plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and volcano plots.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport allows researchers to examine gene expression at different feature levels, such as genes, isoforms, transcription start sites, or coding sequences.
The module can report gene expression data either at the aggregate sample level or at the individual replicate level.
Visualization outputs include confidence intervals and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values to help interpret gene expression changes.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is designed to create publication-ready figures that help researchers quickly understand complex RNA-Seq data.
The module was developed collaboratively by computational biology researchers at MIT and Harvard University.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport requires R version 2.15.3 and automatically checks for and installs necessary supporting R packages.
The module can generate pairwise comparisons between different experimental conditions to highlight significant gene expression changes.
Researchers can control various visualization parameters, such as log transformation of expression values and output file format.
The module produces a database file (cuffData.db) that can be reused for faster subsequent analyses.
CummeRbund.GeneSetReport is particularly useful for exploring relationships between conditions and identifying genes with significant expression differences.
