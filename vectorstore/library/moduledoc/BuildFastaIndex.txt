BuildFastaIndex is on version .
A description of BuildFastaIndex is Indexes a reference sequence in FASTA format. The index file is given the extension FAI..
BuildFastaIndex is a GenePattern module written by Picard team, HUgp-help@broadinstitute.orgUH.
BuildFastaIndex can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
BuildFastaIndex has the following parameters: fasta.file, output.prefix.
The BuildFastaIndex module is a crucial bioinformatics tool for preparing reference genome sequences for downstream analysis.
BuildFastaIndex creates an index file (.fai) that allows rapid random access to specific regions of large genomic sequence files.
The .fai index enables efficient retrieval of genomic sequences without loading entire multi-gigabyte FASTA files into memory.
BuildFastaIndex supports both standard and compressed (gz) FASTA file formats, providing flexibility in input file types.
The module is particularly useful in genomic sequencing workflows like alignment, variant calling, and genome annotation.
BuildFastaIndex generates a lightweight companion file that contains metadata about sequence lengths and offsets within the original FASTA file.
Researchers can use the BuildFastaIndex module to prepare reference genomes for tools like BWA, SAMtools, and other high-throughput sequencing pipelines.
The module works across different computational platforms, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
BuildFastaIndex is essential for managing large genomic datasets, enabling faster and more memory-efficient computational processing.
Bioinformaticians use BuildFastaIndex as a preprocessing step to optimize computational performance in genomic research workflows.
The module can handle multi-sequence FASTA files, creating an index that maps each sequence's location and length within the file.
BuildFastaIndex is part of the Picard toolkit, a widely used collection of tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing data.
fasta.file: File, Required, Specifies the input FASTA sequence file to be indexed, supports gzip compression.
fasta.file represents the source sequence file for BuildFastaIndex module processing.
fasta.file can be a standard or compressed FASTA format genomic sequence file.
output.prefix: String, Required, Defines the base filename for generating the output index file.
output.prefix determines the naming convention for the generated FAI index file.
output.prefix allows users to control the output file's naming and storage location.
BuildFastaIndex module requires a FASTA sequence file as input.
The input FASTA file contains genomic or sequence data with a standard header line starting with '>' followed by sequence information.
BuildFastaIndex module generates a FASTA index (.fai) file as output.
The .fai index file contains metadata about the reference sequence, including sequence name, length, offset, and line length.
The input FASTA file can be uncompressed or gzip compressed (.gz).
The output .fai file enables rapid random access to specific regions of large reference sequence files.
The BuildFastaIndex module supports indexing FASTA files for any genomic or sequence data.
The module can process FASTA files from various sources like genome assemblies, transcriptomes, or protein sequences.
The .fai index file is a plain text file with tab-separated columns describing sequence characteristics.
The BuildFastaIndex module works across different computational platforms and operating systems.
BuildFastaIndex is a computational module designed to create an index for reference genome sequences stored in FASTA format.
The BuildFastaIndex module generates a companion .FAI index file for a given FASTA sequence file.
The module supports input of both standard and gzip-compressed FASTA files.
The .FAI index file enables rapid random access to specific genomic regions without reading the entire sequence file.
BuildFastaIndex can process FASTA files from any organism or genetic source.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system and CPU architecture.
The index generation is implemented in C++ and Perl, ensuring high-performance computational efficiency.
The output .FAI file contains metadata about sequence lengths, offsets, and line structures within the original FASTA file.
BuildFastaIndex is typically used as a preprocessing step for genomic analysis workflows that require quick sequence retrieval.
The module was developed by the Picard team at the Broad Institute, a leader in computational genomics tools.
Users can specify a custom output prefix for the generated index file to organize their computational results.
The module supports indexing of multi-sequence FASTA files, creating a comprehensive index for complex genomic reference datasets.
