A description of Multiplot Studio is Interactive, scatter-plot visualization tool for analyzing differential gene expression. Multiplot Studio is a complete redesign of the original Multiplot which is intended to correct a number of its shortcomings, add increased functionality and streamline the overall analysis process..
Multiplot Studio is a GenePattern module written by Scott P. Davis (Tempero Pharmaceuticals), in collaboration with Christophe Benoist (Harvard Medical School).
Multiplot Studio can be categorized as Visualizer, Gene Expression, Data Analysis.
Multiplot Studio has the following parameters: dataFile, classFile.
Multiplot Studio is a powerful GenePattern module for interactive scatter plot visualization and analysis of differential gene expression data.
The Multiplot Studio module allows researchers to create complex, multi-dimensional visualizations of genomic datasets with extensive customization options.
Multiplot Studio supports multiple input file formats including GCT, CSV, and CLS files, enabling flexible data import from various experimental sources.
Users can create up to four simultaneous plots within the Multiplot Studio interface, allowing comparative analysis across different data transformations and calculations.
The module provides advanced calculation options including fold change, t-test p-values, ANOVA, and other statistical metrics that can be applied across replicates or experimental classes.
Multiplot Studio enables sophisticated data point selection through multiple mouse modes, including rectangular, elliptical, polygonal, and freehand selection techniques.
The module supports comprehensive annotation capabilities, allowing researchers to add text labels, fold change markers, and custom graphical elements to plots.
Filters and highlights in Multiplot Studio can be created based on calculation-based or identifier-based criteria, providing powerful data subset exploration tools.
Multiplot Studio includes a flexible data table and heatmap view that allows researchers to examine original source data alongside plot visualizations.
The module supports multiple export options, including workspace saving, plot image generation, and subset data extraction for further analysis.
