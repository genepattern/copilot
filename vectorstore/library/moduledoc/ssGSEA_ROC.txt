ssGSEA_ROC is on version 1.
A description of ssGSEA_ROC is Generate ROC curves and calculate the AUC from ssGSEA results and a binary phenotype classification. ssGSEA_ROC module implements the R package ROCR to analyze the coherence between ssGSEA enrichment scores for gene sets of interest and assigned phenotypes for the samples (e.g. high or low expression of a specific marker gene). For each gene set, the Matthews correlation coefficient, the area under the curve (AUC), a two-sided wilcox test on the ssSGEA scores and a number of other metrics are calculated..
ssGSEA_ROC is a GenePattern module written by Anthony S. Castanza.
ssGSEA_ROC can be categorized as Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, ROC Analysis.
ssGSEA_ROC has the following parameters: PROJ gct, CLS, Reverse, Plot Top Results.
The ssGSEA_ROC module helps researchers analyze gene set enrichment scores across different phenotypes.
The ssGSEA_ROC module generates receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate gene set performance in distinguishing between two biological conditions.
ssGSEA_ROC uses the R package ROCR to calculate statistical metrics like area under the curve (AUC) and Matthews correlation coefficient for gene sets.
The module requires two primary input files: a gene set enrichment results file (PROJ.gct) and a phenotype classification file (CLS).
ssGSEA_ROC can help researchers identify which gene sets are most predictive of a specific biological state or disease condition.
The module produces both a PDF visualization of top-performing gene sets and a detailed tab-delimited text file with comprehensive statistical results.
Researchers can use ssGSEA_ROC to compare gene set performance across different phenotypes, such as disease versus healthy states.
The ssGSEA_ROC module provides flexibility in analysis direction through its "Reverse" parameter, allowing researchers to examine phenotype comparisons from multiple perspectives.
ssGSEA_ROC is particularly useful in cancer research, genomics, and other fields where distinguishing between biological states is critical.
The module leverages advanced statistical techniques to quantify the discriminatory power of gene sets across different biological conditions.
