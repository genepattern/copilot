Picard.SamToFastq is on version 3.
A description of Picard.SamToFastq is This module converts a file in SAM format (or its binary equivalent, BAM format) to FASTQ format. SAM is a standard short read alignment that allows aligners to attach custom tags to individual alignments..
Picard.SamToFastq is a GenePattern module written by Picard Contact: gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
Picard.SamToFastq can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
Picard.SamToFastq has the following parameters: input file, per read group, re-reverse bases, include non pf reads, clipping attribute, clipping action, clipping action quality value, fastq output prefix 1, fastq output prefix 2.
The Picard.SamToFastq module is a critical bioinformatics tool for converting sequencing alignment files between different formats.
Picard.SamToFastq allows researchers to transform SAM or BAM alignment files into the more universally readable FASTQ format.
The module is particularly useful when transitioning between different sequencing analysis pipelines that require specific file formats.
Picard.SamToFastq can handle both single-end and paired-end sequencing read data during the conversion process.
Researchers can use this module to extract raw sequencing reads from alignment files, which is essential for downstream analysis like de novo assembly or re-alignment.
The module provides flexible options for handling read groups, allowing conversion of entire sequencing datasets or specific subsets of reads.
Picard.SamToFastq can optionally re-reverse bases and qualities for reads aligned to the negative strand, ensuring accurate representation of original sequencing data.
Bioinformaticians can use this module to preprocess alignment files, removing alignment-specific metadata and returning to the original sequencing read format.
The module supports optional filtering of reads based on quality metrics, such as excluding non-passing filter (non-PF) reads from the output.
Picard.SamToFastq is implemented in Java, making it highly portable across different computational platforms and operating systems.
Researchers can use this module as part of larger genomic data processing workflows, bridging different stages of sequencing data analysis.
The module provides granular control over read clipping, allowing users to modify read lengths or base qualities during the conversion process.
Picard.SamToFastq module helps convert SAM or BAM alignment files to FASTQ format
input file is a required parameter specifying the source SAM or BAM file to convert
re-reverse bases is an optional boolean parameter to reverse bases and qualities for reads with negative strand flag
include non pf reads is an optional boolean parameter to include reads that did not pass quality filtering
clipping attribute specifies the SAM tag storing the position where reads should be clipped
clipping action determines how clipped reads are processed when a clipping attribute is present
clipping action quality value sets base quality values when clipping action changes base qualities
fastq output prefix 1 defines the output filename for single-end or first-end paired FASTQ files
fastq output prefix 2 defines the output filename for second-end paired FASTQ files
per read group is an optional boolean parameter to control whether output files are generated per read group
Picard.SamToFastq supports conversion between standard genomic file formats for bioinformatics processing
module requires Java runtime and works across different operating systems and CPU architectures
conversion process preserves read alignment metadata and allows flexible handling of read quality and clipping
