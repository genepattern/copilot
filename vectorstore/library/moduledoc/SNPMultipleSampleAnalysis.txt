SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis is on version .
A description of SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis is Analysis of copy number aberration data for the identification of concordant aberration across multiple samples. SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis (SNP-MSA) identifies regions of concordance across a class of samples. This module is an implementation of the Multiple Sample Analysis (MSA) algorithm. MSA identifies regions of significant concordant structure across multiple samples in a statistically rigorous, multiple testing corrected, non-parametric framework..

SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis is a computational method for identifying concordant copy number aberrations across multiple genetic samples.
The SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis module analyzes genomic data to detect statistically significant regions of structural variation across multiple samples.
This module can process different input file formats including .cn, .xcn, .snp, and log ratio text files containing genetic data.
The algorithm uses a non-parametric, multiple testing corrected approach to identify regions of significant concordant genomic structure.
SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis was developed by Mitchell Guttman at the Broad Institute to analyze comparative genomic hybridization and SNP chip data.
The module requires a data file and a cytoband file, with a default human genome (Hg18) cytoband file provided.
SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis handles missing data by using a flag value of -999 to indicate skipped or unavailable genetic measurements.
The module generates multiple output files including heat map images, confidence files, and visualizations of genomic aberration frequencies.
Users can specify parameters like number of permutations, resolution, significance level, and which chromosomes to analyze.
The algorithm can detect both genomic gains (amplifications) and losses across multiple experimental samples.
SNPMultipleSampleAnalysis produces statistical confidence measures for each genomic location to assess the significance of observed variations.
The module's output includes visual representations like chromosome ideograms showing aberration patterns and confidence levels.
Researchers can use this tool to identify recurrent genetic alterations across multiple samples in cancer research, developmental biology, and other genetic studies.
