ARACNE is on version 1.0.
A description of ARACNE is ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) is an algorithm which reverse engineers a gene regulatory network from microarray gene expression data. ARACNE uses mutual information(MI), an information theoretical measure, to compute the correlation between pairs of genes and infer a best-fit network of probable interactions..
ARACNE is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire (Broad Institute).
ARACNE can be categorized as Reverse Engineering.
ARACNE has the following parameters: dataset.file, hub.gene, hub.genes.file, transcription.factor.file, kernel.width, mi.threshold, p.value, dpi.tolerance, mean.filter, cv.filter, output.file.
The ARACNE GenePattern module is an algorithm for reconstructing gene regulatory networks from microarray expression data.
ARACNE helps biologists understand complex gene interactions by mapping potential regulatory relationships between genes.
The ARACNE module uses mutual information (MI) as a statistical method to quantify gene interactions and connectivity.
ARACNE calculates the mutual information between every pair of genes in a dataset to create an initial network adjacency matrix.
The module allows researchers to specify a specific "hub gene" or set of hub genes to focus the network reconstruction analysis.
ARACNE can incorporate transcription factor information to refine the network reconstruction and remove indirect interactions.
The module uses a Data Processing Inequality (DPI) tolerance to remove potentially spurious or indirect gene interactions.
Researchers can set parameters like kernel width, mutual information threshold, and DPI tolerance to customize the network reconstruction.
The ARACNE module generates an adjacency matrix output file (.adj) that describes the potential interactions between genes.
ARACNE is particularly useful for systems biology and computational biology researchers studying gene regulatory networks.
The module can filter out non-informative genes using mean expression and coefficient of variance parameters.
ARACNE helps translate large-scale gene expression data into interpretable network models of cellular interactions.
The algorithm was originally developed to reconstruct regulatory networks in mammalian cellular contexts.
Researchers can use ARACNE to generate hypotheses about gene interactions and potential regulatory mechanisms.
The module is flexible and can be applied to various types of gene expression datasets across different biological systems.

ARACNE output file (.adj): A symmetric adjacency matrix file with gene interactions and mutual information (MI) scores, including a header with module parameters and gene interaction details
ARACNE input file contains gene expression measurements used to compute mutual information between gene pairs for network reconstruction
ARACNE hub.gene parameter allows specifying a single gene for network interaction analysis as an alternative to the hub.genes.file
ARACNE transcription factor file helps refine network reconstruction by identifying potential regulatory genes for more precise interaction modeling
ARACNE output file provides a comprehensive representation of gene interactions with corresponding mutual information scores and module execution parameters
ARACNE input dataset supports multiple file formats (.res, .gct) to accommodate different gene expression data representations
ARACNE output file uses a symmetric matrix format where gene interaction strengths are bidirectional and represented by mutual information values
ARACNE is an algorithm for reconstructing gene regulatory networks from microarray gene expression data.
ARACNE uses mutual information (MI) to compute correlations between gene pairs and infer potential interactions.
The ARACNE algorithm calculates mutual information between all gene pairs and creates an initial adjacency matrix.
MI thresholding is applied to remove gene pairs with MI scores below a specified threshold, reducing potential false interactions.
The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) tolerance further refines the network by removing indirect interactions between genes.
ARACNE can focus on a specific hub gene or set of hub genes for network reconstruction.
Users can optionally provide a transcription factor file to improve the specificity of the network reconstruction.
The kernel width parameter controls the smoothness of the probability density function estimation in the algorithm.
MI threshold and p-value parameters allow users to control the statistical significance of gene interactions.
The DPI tolerance parameter helps remove potential false positive interactions, typically set between 0 and 0.15.
Mean and coefficient of variance filters can be used to remove non-informative genes from the analysis.
The output is an adjacency matrix file (.adj) containing gene interactions and their mutual information scores.
The ARACNE module is implemented in Java and can run on any platform with Java JVM 1.5 or higher.
The algorithm is particularly useful for understanding transcriptional regulatory networks in biological systems.
ARACNE has been applied to various biological contexts, including studies of mammalian cellular networks and human B cells.
