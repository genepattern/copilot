FileSplitter is on version 1.
A description of FileSplitter is Splits the lines in a text file into multiple files. Takes a text file as input and splits the lines of the input file into the desired number of output files..
FileSplitter is a GenePattern module written by Peter Carr, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
FileSplitter can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
FileSplitter has the following parameters: inputFile, numFiles, numLines.
The FileSplitter GenePattern module allows researchers to divide large text files into smaller, more manageable chunks for computational processing.
The FileSplitter module is useful for breaking down large genomic datasets that are too large to process in a single computational run.
Bioinformaticians can use the FileSplitter module to prepare input files for parallel computing workflows, distributing computational load across multiple processors or machines.
The FileSplitter module supports two primary splitting strategies: splitting by total number of output files or by maximum lines per output file.
When splitting files by number of files, the FileSplitter module will attempt to create roughly equal-sized chunks of data across the specified number of output files.
The FileSplitter module generates output files with a consistent naming convention, appending a numerical index to the original filename to distinguish between split segments.
Researchers working with large sequencing datasets like RNA-seq or whole genome sequencing can use the FileSplitter module to prepare data for downstream analysis tools.
The FileSplitter module is platform-independent, running on any operating system with a Java runtime environment, making it highly versatile for different computational infrastructures.
Computational biologists can leverage the FileSplitter module to manage memory constraints by breaking large files into smaller, more memory-efficient chunks.
The FileSplitter module provides flexibility in file splitting, allowing users to specify either the total number of output files or the maximum number of lines per output file.
inputFile: String, required parameter for FileSplitter module that specifies the text file to be split into multiple output files.
numFiles: Integer, optional parameter for FileSplitter module that defines the maximum number of output files to create, must be >= 1.
numLines: Integer, optional parameter for FileSplitter module that sets the maximum number of lines per output file, must be >= 1, can be overridden by file size division.
FileSplitter module takes a single input text file and divides its contents across multiple output files.
Output files are named with the original input file's base name and a numerical suffix.
Output files are generated in numerical order, starting from file index 0.
FileSplitter module works across different CPU types and operating systems.
FileSplitter module is classified as a preprocessing and utility module.
FileSplitter module is implemented in Java programming language.
Module supports flexible file splitting strategies using numFiles and numLines parameters.
Module allows users to control output file count and line distribution.
Module generates predictably named output files based on input file characteristics.
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the FileSplitter module:
FileSplitter input file is a text file containing lines of data to be split.
FileSplitter input file can be any plain text file with multiple lines of content.
FileSplitter input file format is a standard text file with no specific structural requirements.
FileSplitter numFiles parameter determines the maximum number of output files to create.
FileSplitter numLines parameter specifies the maximum number of lines per output file.
FileSplitter output files are named with the input file's base name and a numerical suffix.
FileSplitter output files are text files containing chunks of lines from the original input file.
FileSplitter output files are generated in numerical order, starting from 0.
FileSplitter output files preserve the original line order from the input file.
FileSplitter output files will have an equal or near-equal number of lines based on the input parameters.
The FileSplitter module is a utility tool for dividing large text files into multiple smaller files.
The FileSplitter module allows users to split a single input text file into multiple output files based on specified parameters.
The FileSplitter module can split files by specifying either the maximum number of output files or the maximum number of lines per output file.
The FileSplitter module generates output files with a naming convention of <inputFile.base_name>_<file#>.txt, where file# starts from 0.
The FileSplitter module is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system using Java.
The input file parameter requires a text file as the source for splitting.
The numFiles parameter determines the maximum number of output files to create, which must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
The numLines parameter specifies the maximum number of lines allowed in each output file, also requiring an integer value greater than or equal to 1.
When both numFiles and numLines are set, the FileSplitter module will prioritize the maximum number of files.
The FileSplitter module is classified as a preprocessing and utility tool in the GenePattern module ecosystem.
The initial version of the FileSplitter module was released on November 7, 2012.
