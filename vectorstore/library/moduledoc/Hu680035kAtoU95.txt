Module supports conversion for Global Cancer Map (GCM) dataset analysis
Hu680035kAtoU95 is a GenePattern module for converting microarray probe identifiers between different Affymetrix platforms.
The module translates probe identifiers from Hu6800 and Hu35KsubA microarray platforms to their corresponding probes on the U95Av2 platform.
This module supports three input file formats: .pol (parametrized ordered list), .tag (tab-delimited), and .grp (simple list) files containing probe identifiers.
The conversion is based on a curated look-up table created by Ken Ross, enabling researchers to map older microarray probe identifiers to newer platform probes.
The module is particularly useful for researchers working with the Global Cancer Map dataset, which was originally generated using Hu6800 and Hu35KsubA platforms.
Some probe identifiers may map to multiple U95Av2 probes, while others might not have any corresponding features on the new platform.
The module was developed to support research published in key papers by Ramaswamy et al. on cancer molecular signatures and multiclass cancer diagnosis.
The output files maintain the same format as the input files, with additional columns showing the mapped U95Av2 probe identifiers.
This module is platform-independent and can run on any operating system with a Perl interpreter, making it widely accessible to researchers.
The module is designed as a preprocessing utility to facilitate cross-platform microarray data analysis and comparison.
