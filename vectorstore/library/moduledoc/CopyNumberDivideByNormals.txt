CopyNumberDivideByNormals is on version .
A description of CopyNumberDivideByNormals is Determines the raw copy number of a target SNP by dividing the intensity value of the target SNP by the mean intensity value of all normal SNPs (copy number normalization)..
CopyNumberDivideByNormals is a GenePattern module written by David Twomey and Joshua Gould.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals has the following parameters: snp file, sample info file, include genotype calls, output file name.
The CopyNumberDivideByNormals module is a computational tool for analyzing genetic copy number variations in SNP data.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals helps researchers normalize genetic intensity signals by comparing target samples against normal samples.
The module performs copy number normalization by dividing the intensity of a target SNP by the mean intensity of normal SNPs.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals requires an input .snp file that contains both normal and target genetic samples for accurate analysis.
The module can generate two types of output files: a .cn file without genotype information or an .xcn file with genotype call details.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals is particularly useful in cancer research for identifying genetic copy number alterations in tumor samples.
The module uses a sample information file to distinguish between normal (ploidy=2) and target samples during copy number calculation.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals enables researchers to quantify genetic copy number variations across different genetic samples.
The module is platform-independent and can be run on various operating systems and computer architectures.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals provides a standardized approach to normalizing genetic intensity signals across different samples.
snp file: File (required), Contains both normal and target samples for copy number analysis in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
sample info file: Tab-delimited file (required), Provides sample metadata for CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
sample info file must have Sample column identifying sample names in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
sample info file must have Ploidy(numeric) column to distinguish normal (ploidy=2) and target samples in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
include genotype calls: Boolean parameter (required), Determines whether output file includes genotype information in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
include genotype calls: yes creates .xcn file with genotype calls in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
include genotype calls: no creates .cn file without genotype calls in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
output file name: String (required), Specifies name of output file generated by CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
output file name determines final file extension (.cn or .xcn) based on include genotype calls parameter in CopyNumberDivideByNormals module
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the CopyNumberDivideByNormals module:
CopyNumberDivideByNormals module requires a GenePattern .snp file as input containing both normal and target samples.
The .snp input file is generated using the SNPFileCreator module from Affymetrix SNP chip CEL files.
The input .snp file contains intensity values for each probe across multiple samples.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals module requires a sample information file in tab-delimited format.
The sample information file must include columns for Sample name and Ploidy(numeric) to distinguish normal and target samples.
The module generates an output file with raw copy number values replacing original intensity values.
The output file can be either .cn (without genotype calls) or .xcn (with genotype calls) based on user parameter selection.
The .xcn output file is required by the SNPViewer module for further analysis.
The module also generates a standard output file listing the normal and target samples used in the copy number calculation.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals is a computational module for determining raw copy number of target SNPs.
The module calculates copy number by dividing the intensity of a target SNP by the mean intensity of normal SNPs.
CopyNumberDivideByNormals requires a GenePattern .snp file containing both normal and target sample data.
The input .snp file is typically created using the SNPFileCreator module from Affymetrix SNP chip CEL files.
The module generates an output file that replaces probe intensity values with their raw copy number calculations.
Output files can include genotype call information (.xcn) or exclude it (.cn), depending on user parameter selection.
The sample information file is a tab-delimited document specifying sample characteristics like name and ploidy.
Normal samples are defined as having a ploidy of 2, while samples with different ploidy values are considered target samples.
The module supports flexible output file naming and can run on any CPU and operating system using Java.
SNPViewer module requires the .xcn file format with genotype call information for further analysis.
The module performs copy number normalization by comparing target SNP intensities to the mean of normal SNP intensities.
