WeightedVotingXValidation is on version .
A description of WeightedVotingXValidation is The weighted voting algorithm makes a weighted linear combination of relevant "marker" or "informative" genes obtained in the training set to provide a classification scheme for new samples. Target classes (classes 0 and 1) can be for example defined based on a phenotype such as morphological class or treatment outcome..
WeightedVotingXValidation is a GenePattern module written by Ken Ross (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
WeightedVotingXValidation can be categorized as Prediction.
WeightedVotingXValidation has the following parameters: data.filename, class.filename, pred.results.file, feature.summary.file, num.features.
The WeightedVotingXValidation module is a machine learning classifier for gene expression data that uses a weighted voting algorithm to predict sample classes.
The WeightedVotingXValidation module helps researchers classify biological samples based on gene expression patterns by identifying the most informative genes.
WeightedVotingXValidation uses a signal-to-noise statistic to select marker genes that best distinguish between two classes of biological samples.
In the WeightedVotingXValidation method, each selected gene "votes" for a particular class based on its expression level and statistical characteristics.
The WeightedVotingXValidation algorithm calculates a confidence score for its predictions by comparing the votes for the winning and losing classes.
WeightedVotingXValidation employs a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to test the reliability of its classification model.
The module was originally developed for molecular cancer classification, helping researchers predict cancer subtypes or treatment outcomes.
WeightedVotingXValidation can be used in various biological contexts, such as distinguishing between different disease states or experimental conditions.
The algorithm behind WeightedVotingXValidation is similar to the Naïve Bayes classification method, making it a robust machine learning approach.
Researchers can use WeightedVotingXValidation to identify key genes that are most important for distinguishing between different biological classes.

Contains details about selected marker genes and their signal-to-noise statistics in the Weighted Voting model
num.features: integer, number of top features to select using signal-to-noise statistic, required, no default value
Determines how many genes are used as informative markers in the Weighted Voting classification algorithm
Weighted Voting module selects the most discriminative genes based on signal-to-noise ratio
The algorithm computes a signal-to-noise statistic for each gene to identify the most informative features
Weighted Voting uses a voting mechanism where each selected gene casts a vote for the predicted class
The final prediction is determined by the aggregate weighted votes of the selected marker genes
Cross-validation is performed by iteratively leaving out one sample and training on the remaining data
WeightedVotingXValidation module requires a gene expression data file in GCT, RES, or ODF format containing gene expression measurements.
WeightedVotingXValidation module needs a class file in CLS format defining the binary classification labels for training samples.
WeightedVotingXValidation module generates a prediction results file in ODF format containing classification predictions for each sample.
WeightedVotingXValidation module produces a feature summary file in ODF format listing the selected marker genes and their signal-to-noise statistics.
WeightedVotingXValidation module input data file should contain gene expression values with genes as rows and samples as columns.
WeightedVotingXValidation module class file must specify two classes (0 and 1) corresponding to different phenotypes or treatment outcomes.
WeightedVotingXValidation module prediction results file includes predicted class labels, voting scores, and prediction confidence for each sample.
WeightedVotingXValidation module feature summary file provides details about the most informative genes selected for classification.
WeightedVotingXValidation module performs leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the classifier's performance.
WeightedVotingXValidation module uses signal-to-noise statistic to select the most discriminative genes for classification.
The WeightedVotingXValidation module is a machine learning classifier for gene expression data that predicts sample classes using a weighted voting algorithm.
The module uses signal-to-noise statistic (Sx) to select informative marker genes from training data.
For each gene, the WeightedVotingXValidation calculates a decision boundary (Bx) halfway between class means.
During prediction, each gene in the WeightedVotingXValidation module casts a vote based on its signal-to-noise statistic and the gene's deviation from the decision boundary.
The WeightedVotingXValidation module determines the final class prediction by summing these votes and using the sign of the total vote.
The prediction confidence in the WeightedVotingXValidation is calculated as the relative margin of victory between winning and losing vote totals.
The WeightedVotingXValidation uses leave-one-out cross-validation, iteratively training on all but one sample and testing on the left-out sample.
The module was originally developed for molecular cancer classification based on gene expression data from pioneering work by Golub and colleagues.
The WeightedVotingXValidation algorithm is mathematically similar to the Naïve Bayes classification method.
The module requires input files for gene expression data, class labels, and allows specification of the number of features to select.
