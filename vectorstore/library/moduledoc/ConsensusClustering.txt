ConsensusClustering is on version 8.
A description of ConsensusClustering is Resampling-based clustering. Given a set of items to be clustered (items can be either genes or chips/experiments), Consensus clustering provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters..
ConsensusClustering is a GenePattern module written by Stefano Monti (Broad Institute) gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
ConsensusClustering can be categorized as Clustering.
ConsensusClustering has the following parameters: input filename, kmax, resampling iterations, seed value, clustering algorithm, cluster by, distance measure, resample, merge type, descent iterations, output stub, normalize type, normalization iterations, create heat map, heat map size.
The ConsensusClustering module is a powerful bioinformatics tool for robust cluster analysis in GenePattern.
ConsensusClustering helps researchers discover stable and reliable clusters in complex biological datasets.
The module uses a resampling-based approach to assess the consistency of clustering results across multiple iterations.
ConsensusClustering can be applied to both gene expression data and experimental data, providing flexibility in analysis.
The module generates consensus matrices that show how frequently different data points are clustered together across multiple runs.
ConsensusClustering allows researchers to explore different numbers of potential clusters (from 2 to kmax) to find the most meaningful grouping.
The module supports multiple clustering algorithms, distance measures, and resampling strategies to suit different research needs.
ConsensusClustering produces visual outputs like heatmaps and statistical plots to help researchers interpret clustering results.
Researchers can use ConsensusClustering to identify robust gene groups or experimental conditions with consistent clustering patterns.
The module is particularly useful for analyzing microarray and other high-dimensional biological datasets where traditional clustering might be less reliable.
ConsensusClustering helps reduce the impact of random variation by repeatedly sampling and re-clustering the data.
The module generates multiple output files, including cluster assignments, consensus matrices, and statistical visualization PDFs.
ConsensusClustering can cluster data by rows (genes) or columns (experiments), providing versatility in data exploration.
The tool is platform-independent and runs on various operating systems with Java support.
ConsensusClustering is part of the GenePattern suite, making it accessible to biologists and computational researchers alike.

ConsensusClustering output file <output.stub>.<sampleid>.statistics.pdf includes statistical plots for determining optimal cluster number.
ConsensusClustering consensus matrix entries represent the proportion of times two items are clustered together across multiple resampling iterations.
ConsensusClustering output files are generated for each number of clusters specified by the kmax parameter.
ConsensusClustering is a resampling-based clustering method for discovering and visualizing clusters in gene expression data.
ConsensusClustering generates multiple clustering iterations by perturbing the original dataset through resampling techniques.
The module applies a chosen clustering algorithm to each perturbed dataset to assess cluster stability and agreement.
A consensus matrix is created where each entry represents the proportion of times two items are clustered together across iterations.
ConsensusClustering can generate consensus matrices for different numbers of clusters (from 2 to kmax) to help determine the optimal cluster count.
The module supports clustering by rows (genes) or columns (experiments) using various distance measures and clustering algorithms.
Resampling can be performed through subsampling (default 80%), feature selection, or no sampling.
Output files include cluster membership lists, consensus matrices, heatmaps, and statistical plots for cluster validation.
The statistical plots (Lorenz curve, Gini index, Consensus CDF) help researchers visually assess the most appropriate number of clusters.
ConsensusClustering is implemented in Java and R, and is compatible with multiple platforms and operating systems.
The module was developed by Stefano Monti at the Broad Institute to provide a robust method for class discovery in gene expression data.
The underlying methodology is based on a 2003 Machine Learning Journal publication by Monti et al. on consensus clustering techniques.
