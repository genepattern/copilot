CoGAPS is a computational method for matrix factorization of gene expression data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.
The CoGAPS module allows researchers to decompose gene expression matrices into underlying biological patterns.
CoGAPS seeks to represent a data matrix D as the product of two lower-dimensional matrices: a pattern matrix P and a distribution matrix A.
The algorithm assumes an atomic prior distribution for matrices A and P, which means most matrix elements are expected to be zero.
CoGAPS uses a stochastic sampling approach to infer the most likely pattern and distribution matrices that reconstruct the original gene expression data.
The module allows users to specify a range of pattern numbers to search, helping identify the optimal number of underlying biological patterns.
CoGAPS can handle different input file formats including gct, mtx, and Seurat RDS objects for gene expression data.
The algorithm computes standard deviations for the pattern and distribution matrices, providing uncertainty estimates for the inferred patterns.
CoGAPS can compute Z-scores and p-values to assess the statistical significance of gene set activities within the discovered patterns.
The method was originally developed for microarray data but can be applied to various types of high-dimensional data beyond gene expression.
The implementation combines R and C++ for computational efficiency, using the Rcpp package for integration.
Users can specify the number of iterations, allowing control over the computational complexity and precision of the matrix factorization.
The module generates multiple output files, including matrices of mean patterns, standard deviations, and visualizations of pattern search results.
CoGAPS is particularly useful for discovering coordinated gene expression patterns and understanding underlying biological processes.
The algorithm is flexible and can be applied to various domains beyond gene expression, such as spectral imaging and other matrix decomposition problems.
