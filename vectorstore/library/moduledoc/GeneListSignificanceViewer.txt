GeneListSignificanceViewer is on version .
A description of GeneListSignificanceViewer is Views the results from marker analysis. This is a tool that allows the user to view the gene lists produced by the gene neighbor analysis tools ClassNeighbors and GeneNeighbors. For viewing the results of ClassNeighbors, the viewer includes an interactive plot of the permuted scores. When viewing the results of GeneNeighbors, the viewer includes a plot of the distance to the reference gene vs. the gene rank..
GeneListSignificanceViewer is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
GeneListSignificanceViewer can be categorized as Visualization, Gene Analysis.
GeneListSignificanceViewer has the following parameters: input file.
The GeneListSignificanceViewer is a GenePattern module for visualizing and analyzing gene marker results from ClassNeighbors and GeneNeighbors analysis tools.
The GeneListSignificanceViewer provides an interactive graphical interface for exploring gene marker data and statistical relationships.
For ClassNeighbors results, the GeneListSignificanceViewer generates an interactive plot displaying permuted statistical scores across different gene classes.
For GeneNeighbors results, the GeneListSignificanceViewer creates a plot showing the relationship between gene distance to a reference gene and gene ranking.
The GeneListSignificanceViewer allows users to interactively select and highlight data points in both the plot and accompanying data table, enabling detailed exploration of gene marker information.
Users of the GeneListSignificanceViewer can zoom in and out of plots, reset plot scales, and perform various data selection and navigation tasks through intuitive menu options.
The GeneListSignificanceViewer supports data export features like saving plot images, printing plots, and copying selected table elements for further analysis.
Previously, the GeneListSignificanceViewer integrated with GeneCruiser for retrieving additional probe identifier annotations, though this feature is no longer supported as of March 2016.
The GeneListSignificanceViewer is a Java-based visualizer module compatible with multiple computing platforms and requires Java JVM level 1.5 or higher.
The primary input for the GeneListSignificanceViewer is an ODF format file generated by marker analysis tools like ClassNeighbors and GeneNeighbors.
