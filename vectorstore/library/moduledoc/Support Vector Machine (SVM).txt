Support Vector Machine (SVM) is on version .
A description of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is Classify samples using SVM. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) module implements the support vector machines algorithm for supervised classification methods to compute a maximal separating hyperplane between the expression vectors of different classes or phenotypes..
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be categorized as Prediction.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) has the following parameters: train.data.filename, train.cls.filename, saved.model.filename, test.data.filename, test.cls.filename, pred.results.file, model.output.file.
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) module in GenePattern is a powerful tool for supervised classification of biological data.
The SVM module can create predictive models from microarray gene expression datasets to classify samples into different phenotypic groups.
SVM works by finding a maximal separating hyperplane between different classes of expression vectors, effectively creating a mathematical boundary between sample groups.
Each gene's expression value contributes to the classification, with the magnitude of its coefficient in the hyperplane indicating its importance in distinguishing between classes.
The module supports three primary operational modes: training a model, testing with a saved model, or simultaneously training and testing a model.
SVM can handle various input file formats like .gct and .res for gene expression data, and .cls for class labels, providing flexibility in data preparation.
The module allows saving trained models for future use, enabling researchers to apply a single classification strategy across multiple datasets.
By analyzing the weights assigned to each gene, researchers can identify which genes are most critical in distinguishing between different biological conditions.
The SVM module is particularly useful in cancer research, where it can help classify molecular profiles and potentially predict disease subtypes.
Mathematically, the SVM algorithm computes a decision function that separates classes by maximizing the margin between different sample groups.
The module implements advanced machine learning techniques originally developed by statistical learning theorists like Vladimir Vapnik.
Researchers can use the SVM module to build predictive models in various biological contexts, from cancer classification to understanding genetic variations.
The GenePattern SVM module provides a user-friendly interface for complex machine learning techniques, making advanced computational methods accessible to biologists.

SVM module training data input file is a gene expression matrix in .gct or .res format containing numerical expression values for each gene across samples.
SVM module training class file is a .cls format file specifying the class labels corresponding to each sample in the training dataset.
SVM module test data input file is a gene expression matrix in .gct or .res format containing numerical expression values for genes in the test samples.
SVM module test class file is a .cls format file specifying the known class labels for samples in the test dataset.
SVM module saved model input file contains a previously trained SVM classification model that can be applied to new test data.
SVM module prediction results output file contains the predicted class labels for test samples based on the trained SVM model.
SVM module model output file stores the trained SVM classification model for potential future use on additional test datasets.
SVM module supports multiclass molecular classification using support vector machine learning algorithm.
SVM module can perform model training, testing with a saved model, or simultaneous training and testing workflows.
SVM module requires matching dimensions between training and test data files to ensure proper classification.
The SVM module is a machine learning classification tool for analyzing microarray gene expression data.
The SVM module uses support vector machines to create a mathematical hyperplane that separates different biological classes based on gene expression patterns.
Each gene's expression value contributes to the classification decision, with the magnitude of its weight indicating its importance in distinguishing between classes.
The SVM module can operate in three modes: training a model, testing with a saved model, or simultaneously training and testing.
The module requires input files including training data (.gct or .res format), training class labels (.cls file), and optionally test data and test class labels.
The mathematical core of SVM involves computing a decision function f(x) = Î£(wi * xi) + b, where wi represents gene weights and b is a bias term.
The module can output two potential files: a prediction results file when testing data is provided, or a saved model file when training data is specified.
The SVM implementation is based on advanced machine learning techniques from computational mathematics and statistical learning theory.
The module supports multiclass classification, allowing analysis of complex biological phenotypes beyond simple binary classification.
Developed by researchers at the Broad Institute, this SVM module is designed for molecular cancer classification and gene expression pattern analysis.
The module's flexibility allows researchers to train models on one dataset and apply them to new, unseen data for predictive analysis.
