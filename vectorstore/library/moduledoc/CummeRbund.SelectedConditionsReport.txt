CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport is on version 1.
A description of CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport is CummeRbund is a visualization package designed to help you navigate through the many inter-related files produced from a Cuffdiff RNA-Seq differential expression analysis and visualize the relevant results. This module provides plots based on a user-provided list of conditions..
CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport is a GenePattern module written by Loyal Goff, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab; David Eby, Broad Institute.
CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport can be categorized as RNA-seq, Visualization, Differential Expression.
CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport has the following parameters: cuffdiff input, selected conditions, output format, feature level, report as aggregate, log transform.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport module is a specialized RNA-Seq data visualization tool in the GenePattern bioinformatics platform.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport helps researchers analyze differential gene expression by generating multiple types of comparative plots across selected experimental conditions.
This module works specifically with Cuffdiff output files, transforming complex RNA-Seq data into visually interpretable graphics for scientific analysis.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport can generate different plot types including MA plots, scatter plots, and volcano plots to help researchers understand gene expression patterns.
Researchers can use the CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport to compare gene expression levels across different experimental conditions at multiple feature levels like genes, isoforms, or transcript start sites.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport allows users to control visualization parameters such as log transformation of expression values and aggregation of replicate data.
This module is part of a collaborative effort between MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Harvard University's Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine department.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport requires the entire Cuffdiff job output folder, not just individual files, to generate comprehensive visualizations.
Volcano plots generated by the CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport help researchers identify genes with both statistically significant and large magnitude expression changes.
The CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport creates a reusable database file that can be used for subsequent analyses, improving computational efficiency.
cuffdiff.input (File, Required): Input for CummeRbund module, which can be a Cuffdiff job folder, previous CummeRbund job, or cuffData.db database file.
selected.conditions (String, Optional): Comma-separated list of specific conditions/samples to include in plots, using names from original Cuffdiff job.
output.format (String, Required): Specifies the file format for output visualizations.
feature.level (String, Required): Determines the biological feature level for reporting, such as genes, isoforms, transcript start sites, or coding sequences.
report.as.aggregate (Boolean, Optional): Controls whether results are reported using individual replicates or aggregated condition/sample values, with default set to aggregate samples.
log.transform (Boolean, Optional): Determines whether FPKM values should be log transformed, with some plots always using log transformation regardless of this setting.
Here are the input and output files for the CummeRbund.SelectedConditionsReport module:
Input Files:
Cuffdiff job folder contains multiple RNA-seq differential expression analysis output files from Cuffdiff
Cuffdiff output files include gene expression measurements, statistical comparisons between conditions, and differential expression results
cuffData.db is an optional pre-processed SQLite database file from a previous CummeRbund job that can be used to speed up processing
Output Files:
cuffData.db is an RSQLite database created from the original Cuffdiff job, which can be reused in future CummeRbund analyses
SelectedConditions.MAplot contains MA plots showing average intensity versus log ratio for pairwise sample comparisons
SelectedConditions.Scatter includes scatter plots with regression lines comparing FPKM values between sample pairs
SelectedConditions.Volcano presents volcano plots visualizing fold change and statistical significance between conditions
stdout.txt and stderr.txt provide logs of the database creation and plotting process, including any errors encountered
Each output file represents a different visualization of the RNA-seq differential expression data, allowing researchers to explore gene expression patterns across experimental conditions.
