SetFCSKeywords is on version 2.
A description of SetFCSKeywords is Sets keyword/value(s) in a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file. Specific metadata information can be stored in FCS data files as part of the TEXT segment in the form of keyword/value pairs..
SetFCSKeywords is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca).
SetFCSKeywords can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
SetFCSKeywords has the following parameters: Input FCS data file, Keywords input file, Output FCS file name.
The SetFCSKeywords module allows researchers to modify metadata in Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files by adding or updating keyword/value pairs.
SetFCSKeywords is a specialized bioinformatics tool for annotating flow cytometry data files with additional descriptive information.
The module can insert custom metadata like experimental details, instrument settings, sample descriptions, and other contextual information into FCS file headers.
Researchers can provide keyword/value pairs through either a CSV file with two columns or a text file containing a formatted FCS TEXT segment chunk.
SetFCSKeywords helps maintain comprehensive documentation of flow cytometry experiments by allowing flexible metadata annotation directly within the data file.
The module preserves the original FCS file's event data and parameters while only modifying the TEXT segment containing metadata.
SetFCSKeywords follows the FCS 3.1 File Standard, ensuring compatibility with flow cytometry data analysis software and repositories.
Potential metadata additions include acquisition date, instrument details, operator name, sample identification, channel configurations, and custom experimental notes.
The module prevents modifications that would compromise the structural integrity of the FCS file, providing a safeguard against accidental data corruption.
SetFCSKeywords is particularly useful for researchers who need to standardize or enhance metadata across multiple flow cytometry datasets.
The module supports adding multiple keywords in a single operation, streamlining the process of comprehensive file annotation.
SetFCSKeywords can be integrated into larger bioinformatics workflows for systematic flow cytometry data management and preprocessing.
input.fcs:
file type is the input FCS data file where keyword/value pairs will be modified
keywords.txt/csv:
file containing keyword/value pairs to add or modify in the FCS file

SetFCSKeywords module input and output file descriptions:
Input FCS data file is a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file containing cytometry event data with existing metadata
Keywords input file is either a CSV with two columns (Keyword and Value) or a text file containing FCS TEXT segment keyword/value pairs
Keywords input file can include metadata like acquisition date, instrument details, sample description, or custom information
Input FCS file can contain up to 1,000,000 events with 24 parameters stored in floating point data type
Input keywords file must follow FCS TEXT segment formatting rules with specific delimiter characters
Output FCS file contains all original events and parameters from input file with new or updated keyword/value pairs
Output FCS file maintains the same file structure and data integrity as the input file
Output FCS file includes additional or modified metadata specified in the keywords input file
Keywords input file must not break FCS file consistency or introduce invalid metadata
Input and output FCS files are compatible with FCS 3.1 file standard specifications
SetFCSKeywords is a GenePattern module for modifying metadata in Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files by adding or updating keyword/value pairs.
The SetFCSKeywords module allows researchers to programmatically edit metadata stored in the TEXT segment of FCS files.
Metadata in FCS files can include information like data acquisition date, cell description, instrument details, sample identification, and custom experimental annotations.
The module supports two input formats for keyword/value pairs: a CSV file with Keyword and Value columns, or a text file containing a raw FCS TEXT segment chunk.
FCS TEXT segments use a delimiter character (any ASCII character) to separate keywords and values, with delimiters appearing at the start and end of each value.
The SetFCSKeywords module ensures FCS file consistency by preventing modifications that would break the file's structural integrity.
The module can handle large FCS files, with estimated maximum memory usage of 1.8 GB and a runtime of 30 seconds for files with 1,000,000 events.
Users can add new keywords, update existing keyword values, or insert custom metadata into FCS files using this GenePattern module.
The module follows the FCS 3.1 File Standard, which defines the technical specifications for flow cytometry data file formatting.
SetFCSKeywords is implemented in Java and is platform-independent, running on any operating system with Java 1.6 or higher.
