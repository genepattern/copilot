TransposeDataset is on version 2.
A description of TransposeDataset is Transposes a dataset much like a matrix can be transposed, the rows become the columns and the columns become the rows..
TransposeDataset is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Team (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
TransposeDataset can be categorized as Preprocess&Utilities.
TransposeDataset has the following parameters: input.filename, output.file.format, ouput.file.name.
The TransposeDataset module in GenePattern allows researchers to quickly swap rows and columns in genomic datasets, facilitating different analytical perspectives.
TransposeDataset is a utility module that mathematically inverts the orientation of a data matrix, transforming rows into columns and columns into rows.
In gene expression analysis, TransposeDataset can help researchers reorient data to prepare it for different types of statistical or visualization techniques.
The TransposeDataset module supports multiple input file formats including .res, .gct, and .odf, providing flexibility for researchers working with various genomic data types.
TransposeDataset can be particularly useful when preparing data for clustering algorithms or when comparing gene expression across different experimental conditions.
By changing the orientation of a dataset, TransposeDataset enables researchers to examine biological data from alternative perspectives, potentially revealing hidden patterns or relationships.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system with Java 1.4 or higher, making it widely accessible to bioinformatics researchers.
TransposeDataset supports output in .gct and .odf formats, allowing researchers to choose the most appropriate file type for downstream analysis.
In microarray studies, TransposeDataset can help researchers quickly reorganize gene expression data to compare samples or genes more effectively.
The TransposeDataset module is a simple but powerful tool for data manipulation in genomic research, enabling researchers to quickly reorient complex biological datasets.

TransposeDataset module produces output in either .gct or .odf file formats
TransposeDataset module input file is a dataset file in .res, .gct, or .odf format containing rows and columns of data to be transposed.
TransposeDataset module input file contains numerical or categorical data with rows representing features or samples and columns representing samples or features.
TransposeDataset module input file can be a gene expression matrix, where rows are genes and columns are samples.
TransposeDataset module output file is a transposed dataset in .gct or .odf format with original rows and columns swapped.
TransposeDataset module output file preserves the original data values but rearranges them so that rows become columns and columns become rows.
TransposeDataset module output file maintains the same data type and structure as the input file, just with a different orientation.
TransposeDataset module supports multiple input file formats including .res, .gct, and .odf for flexible data transposition.
TransposeDataset module allows users to change the perspective of their dataset by interchanging rows and columns.
