Salmon.Indexer is on version 0.5.
A description of Salmon.Indexer is Indexing a transcriptome in order to perform quantification with Salmon (version 1.6.0) and Alevin. In order to quantify gene expression using Salmon or Alevin, the transcriptome must first be indexed. This module performs this indexing step..
Salmon.Indexer is a GenePattern module written by Rob Patro, COMBINE Lab, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland. Wrapped as a module by Anthony S. Castanza, Mesirov Lab, UCSD School of Medicine..
Salmon.Indexer can be categorized as Transcriptomics, RNA-Seq, Quantification, Indexing.
Salmon.Indexer has the following parameters: GTF gz, Transcriptome fa gz, Genome fa gz, Kmer, Index Mode, Use Gencode.
The Salmon.Indexer module is a critical first step in RNA-seq transcript quantification using the Salmon algorithm.
The Salmon.Indexer prepares genomic data for downstream expression analysis by creating an efficient computational index.
Salmon.Indexer generates a specialized data structure that allows rapid alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads.
The module requires three primary input files: a GTF annotation file, a transcriptome FASTA file, and a genome FASTA file.
Salmon.Indexer uses a k-mer based indexing strategy to create a compact representation of the transcriptome.
The default k-mer length for Salmon.Indexer is 31, which can be adjusted based on read length characteristics.
Salmon.Indexer can generate both full and partial decoy-aware indices to improve quantification accuracy.
The module supports specialized processing for Gencode gene annotations with complex identifier formats.
Salmon.Indexer can automatically extract transcript sequences using GFFread if a transcriptome FASTA is not provided.
The output of Salmon.Indexer is a compressed index file used by Salmon for rapid transcript quantification.
Salmon.Indexer is part of the broader GenePattern bioinformatics platform, facilitating reproducible genomic analysis.
The module implements the computational indexing strategy described in the seminal Salmon publication by Patro et al.
Salmon.Indexer is particularly useful for researchers performing differential gene expression and transcript-level analyses.
Salmon.Indexer module parameter descriptions:
GTF gz: File type (string), genomic features file for indexing, gzipped format, required input for transcriptome annotation
Transcriptome fa gz: File type (string), transcript sequence FASTA file, gzipped, optional input with fallback extraction method
Genome fa gz: File type (string), genomic sequence FASTA file, gzipped, required for potential transcript sequence extraction
Kmer: Integer type, odd-numbered minimum match length for indexing, default is 31, adjustable for read length variations
Index Mode: String type, decoy index generation strategy, options include full or partial decoy index configuration
Use Gencode: Boolean type, handling Gencode-specific FASTA record ID formatting with "|" characters, default likely false
