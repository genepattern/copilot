RenameFile is on version 1.
A description of RenameFile is Creates a result file with the contents of the input but with a new name. Where possible, this is done without copying the file but instead by simply making a link. While it is possible to run this with a submitted file, the common use will be to change the name of a result file or a previously uploaded file. Note that the original file will still be present in its original location..
RenameFile is a GenePattern module written by David Eby.
RenameFile can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
RenameFile has the following parameters: input file, output filename, screen filename, force copy.
The RenameFile GenePattern module helps resolve filename compatibility issues in bioinformatics workflows
The RenameFile module allows researchers to modify problematic filenames that might cause errors in downstream computational analyses
RenameFile can create a new file with the same content as the original, using a filesystem link to minimize disk space usage
The module is particularly useful for handling files with special characters like spaces or slashes that can disrupt computational processing
RenameFile provides an option to automatically screen out potentially problematic characters from filenames, replacing them with underscores
Researchers can use RenameFile to prepare files for modules that have strict naming conventions or character restrictions
The module allows precise control over output filename, enabling users to manually specify exact naming requirements
RenameFile is a preprocessing utility that helps standardize file naming across complex bioinformatics pipelines
The module can work with files of any type, making it versatile for different research contexts and data formats
RenameFile does not modify the original file, instead creating a new file with the desired name and identical content
Bioinformaticians can use RenameFile to ensure file compatibility across different computational platforms and analysis tools
The module offers a flexible approach to file renaming without requiring full file re-upload or reprocessing of upstream workflow steps
RenameFile module input.file: file, the input file to be renamed, required, can be any file type except directory
RenameFile module input.file represents the source file that will have its name changed while preserving original content
RenameFile module input.file is a mandatory parameter for the file renaming process
RenameFile module output.filename: string, the new name to be given to the output file, required
RenameFile module output.filename allows users to specify the desired name for the renamed file
RenameFile module output.filename determines the final name of the file after renaming
RenameFile module screen.filename: boolean, automatically screens out problematic characters in the filename, default is true
RenameFile module screen.filename helps prevent issues with special characters that might cause problems in file processing
RenameFile module screen.filename replaces problematic characters with underscores to ensure compatibility
RenameFile module force.copy: boolean, forces a full file copy instead of creating a filesystem link, default is false
RenameFile module force.copy ensures a complete file duplication when linking is not possible or desired
RenameFile module force.copy provides an option to create a new physical copy of the file rather than a link
RenameFile module input file is any file type that needs renaming.
RenameFile module input file can be a result file or previously uploaded file.
RenameFile module input file cannot be a directory.
RenameFile module output file will have identical contents to the input file.
RenameFile module output file will have a new filename specified by the user.
RenameFile module output file is created using a filesystem link when possible.
RenameFile module output file can have problematic characters automatically screened out.
RenameFile module supports creating a full file copy instead of a link using the force.copy parameter.
RenameFile module can handle files with special characters by replacing them with underscores.
RenameFile module allows complete user control over the output filename.
RenameFile module helps solve filename compatibility issues in computational biology workflows
RenameFile addresses problems with special characters like spaces or slashes in filenames that can disrupt computational processing
RenameFile creates a new file with the same content as the original, using a filesystem link to minimize disk space usage
The module can automatically screen out problematic characters in filenames to improve compatibility with downstream analysis tools
RenameFile is particularly useful for renaming result files or previously uploaded files without requiring full reprocessing
The module provides options to force a full file copy or manually control the output filename
RenameFile works across different platforms and does not operate on directory inputs
The module uses a hard link mechanism to create the renamed file, preserving the original file's location and content
RenameFile can help prevent filename parsing errors that might cause computational biology workflows to fail
The module is designed to be a flexible preprocessing utility for managing file naming challenges in scientific computing
