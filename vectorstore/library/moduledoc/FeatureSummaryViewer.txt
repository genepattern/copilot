FeatureSummaryViewer is on version .
A description of FeatureSummaryViewer is Used to view a list of features from a predictor. This is a tool that allows the user to view feature lists such as those produced by the KNN and weighted voting prediction algorithms (KNN, KNNXValidation,.WeightedVoting, and WeightedVotingXValidation). These tables have three columns: feature name, feature description, and number of times features used (for leave-one-out cross-validation)..
FeatureSummaryViewer is a GenePattern module written by Ken Ross, Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
FeatureSummaryViewer can be categorized as Visualizer.
FeatureSummaryViewer has the following parameters: feature_filename.
The FeatureSummaryViewer is a GenePattern module for visualizing and analyzing feature lists from machine learning predictors.
The FeatureSummaryViewer helps researchers explore feature importance in predictive models by displaying interactive feature summaries.
The FeatureSummaryViewer allows users to view feature names, descriptions, and cross-validation usage frequencies in an interactive table and histogram.
The FeatureSummaryViewer supports interactive exploration through features like zooming, selecting, and searching feature lists.
The FeatureSummaryViewer was originally designed to work with machine learning modules like KNN and Weighted Voting prediction algorithms.
The FeatureSummaryViewer provides a graphical interface for understanding which features contribute most to a predictive model's performance.
The FeatureSummaryViewer allows users to copy selected features and save or print visualizations of feature importance.
The FeatureSummaryViewer previously supported GeneCruiser annotations, though this functionality was deprecated in 2016.
The FeatureSummaryViewer operates as a cross-platform Java-based visualizer compatible with multiple operating systems and CPU architectures.
The FeatureSummaryViewer requires an input file containing feature information to generate its interactive summary display.
feature_filename|File|FeatureSummaryViewer module requires an ODF file containing features to be summarized|Required|No default value
The feature_filename parameter specifies the input file for the FeatureSummaryViewer module
The file must be in ODF (Open Data Format) format for feature summary visualization
This parameter is essential for loading feature data into the interactive viewer interface
The file typically contains feature names, descriptions, and cross-validation usage statistics
The FeatureSummaryViewer uses this file to generate an interactive histogram and feature table
Users can explore feature characteristics through this parameter's input file
The ODF file enables detailed feature analysis and annotation retrieval
FeatureSummaryViewer input file (feature_filename):
Feature list file containing three columns for feature name, feature description, and number of times features used in cross-validation
Typically generated by KNN or WeightedVoting prediction algorithms
Structured as an ODF (Open Data Format) file
Contains feature-level statistical information from machine learning model
Represents features selected during predictive model training
Includes quantitative metrics about feature importance and selection frequency
FeatureSummaryViewer output:
Interactive graphical visualization of feature summary data
Includes an interactive histogram showing feature usage
Allows user interaction like zooming, selecting, and exploring feature details
Supports copying table data and saving plot images
Enables visual exploration of feature selection results
Provides detailed feature-level insights from predictive modeling process
The FeatureSummaryViewer is a GenePattern module for visualizing and analyzing feature lists from predictive algorithms.
The FeatureSummaryViewer allows interactive exploration of feature data from machine learning prediction methods like KNN and weighted voting.
The module displays a table with three key columns: feature name, feature description, and number of times features were used in cross-validation.
The FeatureSummaryViewer includes an interactive histogram that dynamically links selected features between the plot and table view.
Users can zoom, pan, and reset the plot view using mouse interactions and menu options in the FeatureSummaryViewer.
The FeatureSummaryViewer supports feature selection, copying, searching, and saving/printing plot images.
Previously, the FeatureSummaryViewer supported GeneCruiser annotations, but this functionality was deprecated in March 2016.
The module requires an input ODF file containing feature data and is compatible with any CPU, operating system, and Java 1.5+.
The FeatureSummaryViewer is classified as a visualizer module in the GenePattern software ecosystem.
