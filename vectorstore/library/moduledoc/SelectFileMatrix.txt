SelectFileMatrix is on version 1.
A description of SelectFileMatrix is Select a matrix from a delimited file. This module takes a delimited text file as input and creates a subset matrix file based on user-specified parameters. It can be used to extract data from a tab-, space-, or comma-separated input file in multiple ways, from a single cell or an individual row/column to a rectangular matrix or a discontinuous selection of partial rows and columns..
SelectFileMatrix is a GenePattern module written by David Eby (Broad Institute), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
SelectFileMatrix can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
SelectFileMatrix has the following parameters: input file, output file base name, start row, end row, start column, end column, delimiter, column select, row select, output rejects.
The SelectFileMatrix GenePattern module is a versatile tool for extracting and manipulating data from delimited text files in bioinformatics research.
SelectFileMatrix allows researchers to precisely select specific rows and columns from large data matrices, such as gene expression datasets.
The module supports multiple delimiter types including tab, comma, and space-separated files, making it flexible for different data formats commonly used in genomic research.
Researchers can use SelectFileMatrix to extract subsets of data by specifying exact row and column indices, ranges, or individual selections using intuitive parameter settings.
SelectFileMatrix is particularly useful for focusing analysis on specific samples, genes, or experimental conditions within large genomic datasets.
The module preserves the original ordering of data during selection, ensuring that the relative positions of selected elements remain consistent with the input file.
With the optional output.rejects parameter, SelectFileMatrix can simultaneously generate a separate file containing the unselected data for comprehensive record-keeping.
SelectFileMatrix is valuable in preprocessing steps of genomic data analysis, allowing researchers to quickly isolate and work with targeted subsets of complex experimental data.
The module is platform-independent and written in Java, making it widely accessible across different computational environments in bioinformatics research.
Researchers can use SelectFileMatrix to prepare data for downstream analyses like clustering, differential expression studies, or pathway investigations by extracting relevant data subsets.
input file:
SelectFileMatrix module requires an input file as a delimited text file.
SelectFileMatrix module uses this file as the source for matrix selection.
Input file must be a text file with consistent delimiters.
output file base name:
SelectFileMatrix module generates output filename based on this parameter.
Output filename will have appropriate extension (.csv or .txt).
Base name allows user to specify custom output filename.
start row:
SelectFileMatrix module allows specifying the starting row for matrix selection.
Row indexing begins at 1.
If not specified, selection starts from the first row of the file.
Enables partial matrix extraction from input file.
end row:
SelectFileMatrix module allows specifying the ending row for matrix selection.
Row indexing begins at 1.
If not specified, selection extends to the last row of the file.
Enables partial matrix extraction from input file.
start column:
SelectFileMatrix module allows specifying the starting column for matrix selection.
Column indexing begins at 1.
If not specified, selection starts from the first column of the file.
Enables partial matrix extraction from input file.
end column:
SelectFileMatrix module allows specifying the ending column for matrix selection.
Column indexing begins at 1.
If not specified, selection extends to the last column of the file.
Enables partial matrix extraction from input file.
delimiter:
SelectFileMatrix module supports tab, comma, and space as column delimiters.
Same delimiter used for input and output files.
Default delimiter is tab.
Multiple consecutive delimiter characters treated as empty columns.
column select:
SelectFileMatrix module allows selecting specific columns by index or range.
Can specify individual columns or column ranges.
Start/end column parameters may further limit selection.
Enables flexible column extraction.
row select:
SelectFileMatrix module allows selecting specific rows by index or range.
Can specify individual rows or row ranges.
Start/end row parameters may further limit selection.
Enables flexible row extraction.
output rejects:
SelectFileMatrix module can generate a separate file for non-selected items.
Reject file named with base filename and .REJECT extension.
Provides option to track excluded data.
SelectFileMatrix module input and output file descriptions:
Input file is a delimited text matrix with multiple possible formats (tab, comma, or space-separated)
Input file contains numeric or text data organized in rows and columns
Input file can have optional header rows describing column names or data characteristics
Input file supports flexible selection of rows and columns using various indexing methods
Input file can be in formats like GCT, RES, or generic delimited text files
Output file contains the selected subset of the input matrix
Output file preserves original data ordering and relative positioning
Output file uses the same delimiter as the input file (tab, comma, or space)
Output file can include only selected rows and columns based on user parameters
Output file name is generated with a base name and appropriate file extension
Optional reject file contains unselected rows and columns from the input matrix
Reject file maintains the original ordering of unselected data
Reject file uses the same delimiter and format as the output file
Reject file is generated when the output.rejects parameter is set to true
SelectFileMatrix is a GenePattern module for extracting specific subsets of data from delimited text files.
The SelectFileMatrix module allows precise matrix selection from input files using multiple indexing strategies.
Users can select matrix subsets using row and column boundary indices, individual index selections, or selection ranges.
The module supports tab, comma, and space-delimited input files for flexible data extraction.
Row and column selections can be specified using parameters like start.row, end.row, column.select, and row.select.
The module preserves the original data ordering when extracting matrix subsets, maintaining relative positions of selected elements.
SelectFileMatrix can optionally generate a reject file containing data elements not meeting the selection criteria.
The module works with various file formats like GCT and RES, though it does not modify file headers or adjust embedded row counts.
Users can combine boundary selectors with individual or range selections to create complex matrix extraction strategies.
The module is platform-independent, written in Java, and can run on any operating system and CPU architecture.
SelectFileMatrix indexes rows and columns starting from 1, allowing intuitive selection of matrix elements.
The output file will use the same delimiter as the input file, maintaining consistent data formatting.
Multiple consecutive delimiter characters are treated as creating empty columns in the matrix selection process.
