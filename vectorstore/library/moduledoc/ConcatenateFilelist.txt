ConcatenateFilelist is on version 1.
A description of ConcatenateFilelist is Concatenates a list of files into a single large file. This module takes a list of files and appends all of them into one large file..
ConcatenateFilelist is a GenePattern module written by Peter Carr, Marc-Dane Nazaire, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
ConcatenateFilelist can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
ConcatenateFilelist has the following parameters: filelist, num header lines, output filename.
The ConcatenateFilelist module in GenePattern is a utility tool for merging multiple text files into a single comprehensive file.
ConcatenateFilelist allows researchers to combine multiple data files with a consistent structure, such as gene expression datasets or annotation tables.
The module is particularly useful when working with large-scale genomic or transcriptomic datasets that are split across multiple files.
ConcatenateFilelist can help streamline data preprocessing by consolidating related files without manual intervention.
Researchers can specify the number of header lines to preserve, ensuring that metadata or column headers are not duplicated in the final output.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system and CPU architecture, making it versatile for different computational environments.
ConcatenateFilelist is designed specifically for text files and will not work with binary file formats like images or compressed archives.
In bioinformatics workflows, ConcatenateFilelist can be used to merge results from multiple sequencing runs, microarray experiments, or computational analyses.
The module is particularly helpful when preparing data for downstream statistical analysis or visualization in tools like R, Python, or specialized genomic software.
ConcatenateFilelist supports reproducible research by providing a standardized method for file consolidation across different computational platforms.
filelist: string, path to a text file containing a list of file paths to concatenate, required, ConcatenateFilelist module requires this input
ConcatenateFilelist module needs a text file with paths of files to be combined
The filelist parameter specifies which files will be merged into a single output file
num header lines: integer, specifies the number of header lines to preserve in the concatenated file, optional, default is likely 0
ConcatenateFilelist module allows control over header line handling during file concatenation
Header lines will be included only once in the final output file
output filename: string, name of the output file where concatenated content will be saved, required, ConcatenateFilelist module needs this to specify destination
ConcatenateFilelist module uses this parameter to determine the name and location of the merged file
The output file will contain contents from all input files in the specified filelist
ConcatenateFilelist module requires a text file listing file paths to concatenate.
The input filelist contains absolute or relative paths to files that will be merged.
The input filelist must be a plain text file with one file path per line.
ConcatenateFilelist module supports specifying header line handling during file concatenation.
The num header lines parameter controls how header rows are processed in the output file.
The output filename parameter determines the name of the merged result file.
The output file contains the concatenated contents of all input files specified in the filelist.
The output file preserves the order of files as listed in the input filelist.
ConcatenateFilelist module does not support concatenating binary files.
The module will include header lines only once in the final output file based on the num header lines setting.
The output file is a plain text file containing merged contents from input files.
The module works across different platforms and operating systems.
ConcatenateFilelist is a preprocessing utility module in the GenePattern suite.
The ConcatenateFilelist module is a utility tool for combining multiple text files into a single comprehensive file.
The ConcatenateFilelist module allows researchers to merge multiple text-based files into one consolidated output file.
This module is designed to work with text files and cannot concatenate binary file formats.
Users must provide a text file containing file paths that specify which files should be merged together.
The module allows specification of header lines, which will be included only once in the final concatenated file.
Users can control the number of header lines to preserve during the file concatenation process.
The ConcatenateFilelist module requires specifying an output filename where the merged file will be saved.
This module is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system using Java.
The module was initially developed in September 2012 as version 1 by researchers at the Broad Institute.
The ConcatenateFilelist module is categorized as a preprocessing and utility tool for data manipulation in genomic research.
Researchers can use this module to streamline file management and consolidate multiple text-based data sources.
The module provides a simple mechanism for combining files without complex data transformation requirements.
