OpenCRAVAT is on version 1.
A description of OpenCRAVAT is OpenCRAVAT is a software package that performs genomic variant interpretation including variant impact, annotation, and scoring. It has a modular architecture with a wide variety of analysis modules that are developed both by the CRAVAT team and the broader variant analysis community..
OpenCRAVAT is a GenePattern module written by Karchin Lab, Johns Hopkins University, wrapped as a module by Ted Liefeld, Mesirov Lab, UCSD School of Medicine.
OpenCRAVAT can be categorized as Genomic Variant Analysis, Annotation, Cancer Informatics.
OpenCRAVAT has the following parameters: data file, Cravat username, Cravat password, Annotations.
The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module enables comprehensive genomic variant interpretation and annotation through a web-based platform.
The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module allows researchers to submit genetic variant lists for detailed computational analysis.
This module supports multiple input file formats including VCF, tab-delimited text, 23andMe, Ancestry, and dbSNP variant files.
The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module currently supports only genome variants in GRCh38 coordinates, with plans to expand to older genome versions.
Researchers can select multiple annotation modules across categories like clinical relevance and variant effect prediction using the OpenCRAVAT module.
The module generates comprehensive output files including a CSV zip file with detailed variant annotations and an interactive HTML results browser.
The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module is developed by the Karchin Lab at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with In Silico Solutions.
Researchers must create a login to use the OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module, which provides access to a wide variety of genomic variant analysis tools.
The module's modular architecture allows for continuous expansion of analysis capabilities through community-developed and team-developed modules.
The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module is particularly useful for cancer-related variant interpretation and comprehensive genomic research.

The OpenCRAVAT GenePattern module is a computational tool for comprehensive genomic variant analysis developed by the Karchin Lab at Johns Hopkins University.
OpenCRAVAT is a software package designed to perform in-depth interpretation of genetic variants through impact assessment, annotation, and scoring.
The module supports multiple input file formats including VCF, tab-delimited text, 23andMe, Ancestry, and dbSNP, with current support limited to GRCh38 genome coordinates.
OpenCRAVAT uses a modular architecture that allows for diverse variant analysis modules developed by both the CRAVAT team and the broader research community.
The module requires a user login to the OpenCRAVAT server and allows selection of multiple annotation modules across different categories like clinical relevance and variant effect prediction.
Output from the OpenCRAVAT module includes a zipped CSV file with detailed variant annotations and an interactive HTML results browser for exploring variant data.
The tool was funded by the National Cancer Institute's ITCR program and developed in collaboration with In Silico Solutions.
The primary scientific publication describing OpenCRAVAT was published in JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics in 2020 by Pagel et al., detailing its integrated informatics approach to cancer-related variant analysis.
The module is designed to be used with GenePattern version 3.9.11 or later in a dockerized environment, ensuring consistent and reproducible computational analysis.
Annotation modules in OpenCRAVAT can be selected from multiple categories, allowing researchers to customize their variant interpretation workflow based on specific research questions.
