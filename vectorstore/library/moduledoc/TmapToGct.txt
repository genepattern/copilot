TmapToGct is on version .
A description of TmapToGct is Converts a TMAP file to GCT file format. This module extracts expression data from a TMAP and writes it to a GCT file. Expression data in the TMAP file is in units of Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM)..
TmapToGct is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Help (gp-help@broadinstitute.org).
TmapToGct can be categorized as RNA-seq.
TmapToGct has the following parameters: input.file, row.labels, row.descriptions, filter.rows, output.prefix.
The TmapToGct module is a GenePattern tool for converting RNA-seq expression data from TMAP to GCT file format.
The TmapToGct module helps researchers transform complex Cufflinks-generated TMAP files into standardized GCT files for downstream analysis.
TmapToGct specifically converts expression measurements from Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) into a more universally readable format.
The module allows researchers to select different identifier types for row labels and descriptions, including reference gene names, transcript IDs, and Cufflinks-generated identifiers.
TmapToGct provides flexibility in data processing by offering an optional row filtering mechanism to exclude rows marked with a "-" in the input file.
The module is platform-independent, meaning it can run on various operating systems and computer architectures without modification.
TmapToGct is particularly useful in RNA-seq data analysis workflows, bridging data from initial transcript quantification to downstream computational genomics tools.
The output of TmapToGct is a standardized GCT file that can be easily imported into other bioinformatics software and analysis platforms.
By converting TMAP files to GCT, the TmapToGct module helps researchers maintain data integrity and compatibility across different computational genomics environments.
The module's ability to select different identifiers makes it adaptable to various experimental designs and research questions in gene expression analysis.
