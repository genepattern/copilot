TCGAImporter is on version 6.
A description of TCGAImporter is This module imports data from TCGA by taking in a GDC manifest file, downloading the files listed on that manifest, renaming them to be human-friendly, and compiling them into a GCT file to be computer-friendly..
TCGAImporter is a GenePattern module written by Edwin Juarez.
TCGAImporter can be categorized as Download dataset.
TCGAImporter has the following parameters: imanifest, metadata, output_file_name, gct, translate_gene_id, cls.
The TCGAImporter GenePattern module is a specialized tool for downloading and processing cancer genomics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
The TCGAImporter module allows researchers to download complex genomic datasets from the National Cancer Institute's comprehensive cancer genomics repository.
TCGAImporter requires two key input files: a manifest file and a metadata file, both obtained from the GDC (Genomic Data Commons) data portal.
The TCGAImporter module can translate complex gene identifiers like ENSEMBL IDs into more readable Hugo Gene Symbols, making data more accessible to researchers.
TCGAImporter can generate multiple output file types, including GCT files for computational analysis and CLS files that classify samples as normal or tumor tissue.
The module is designed to work across different computing platforms, supporting multiple operating systems and running in Python 3.6 environments.
TCGAImporter is particularly useful for cancer research, enabling researchers to quickly download and standardize large-scale genomic datasets from TCGA.
The module includes options to customize data processing, such as choosing whether to generate GCT files or translate gene identifiers.
TCGAImporter is part of the GenePattern suite of bioinformatics tools, designed to make complex genomic data analysis more accessible to researchers.
The module is distributed under a modified BSD license, making it freely available for both academic and potentially commercial research applications.
imanifest: string, path to the manifest file from GDC data portal, required for TCGAImporter module
The manifest file is crucial for specifying which data files to download from TCGA
metadata: string, path to the metadata file from GDC data portal, required for TCGAImporter module
The metadata file provides additional context and information about the downloaded data files
output_file_name: string, base name for output files in TCGAImporter module, required
Determines the naming convention for generated output files like GCT and CLS files
gct: boolean, controls whether a GCT file is created in TCGAImporter module, optional with default value
Determines if the downloaded data will be compiled into a single, computer-friendly GCT format file
translate_gene_id: boolean, controls translation of ENSEMBL IDs to Hugo Gene Symbols in TCGAImporter module, optional
Enables conversion of complex gene identifiers to more readable human gene names
cls: boolean, controls creation of a classification file in TCGAImporter module, optional
Generates a file that separates samples into Normal and Tumor classes based on TCGA Sample ID
TCGAImporter module requires a GDC manifest file as input, which lists files to be downloaded from the TCGA database.
The manifest file is a text-based file containing unique identifiers for specific TCGA data files.
TCGAImporter module requires a metadata file as input, which provides additional details about the files listed in the manifest.
The metadata file is typically a JSON or CSV format containing sample and file-level information from the GDC data portal.
The output GCT file from TCGAImporter contains all downloaded TCGA data in a standardized, tabular format.
The GCT file includes gene expression data with genes as rows and samples as columns, formatted for easy computational analysis.
The optional CLS file created by TCGAImporter classifies samples as either normal tissue or cancer tissue based on TCGA sample identifiers.
The CLS file is a simple text file that provides a binary classification of samples for downstream analysis.
If GCT generation is disabled, TCGAImporter will output multiple text files containing the raw downloaded data.
These text files preserve the original format of the downloaded TCGA data files before any transformation.
TCGAImporter is a GenePattern module designed to import data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) by processing manifest and metadata files.
The TCGAImporter module allows researchers to download genomic data files from the GDC data portal.
Users must obtain a manifest file and metadata file from the GDC data portal before using the TCGAImporter module.
The TCGAImporter module can translate ENSEMBL gene identifiers to standard Hugo Gene Symbols during data import.
The module can generate a GCT (Gene Cluster Text) file containing downloaded genomic data in a standardized format.
TCGAImporter can optionally create a CLS file that classifies samples as normal or tumor tissue based on TCGA sample identifiers.
The module is implemented in Python 3.6 and can run on any operating system with compatible computational infrastructure.
TCGAImporter supports downloading various types of genomic data, with future plans to implement copy number variation parsing.
The module requires the GDC download client to be present in the same directory for successful data retrieval.
Users can specify parameters like input manifest, metadata file, output file name, and options for gene ID translation and file generation.
TCGAImporter is distributed under a modified BSD license and is part of the GenePattern computational genomics toolkit.
The module has undergone multiple version updates to improve performance and compatibility with GDC metadata formats.
