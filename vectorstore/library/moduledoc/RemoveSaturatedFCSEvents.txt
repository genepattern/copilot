RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is on version 1.
A description of RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is Remove saturated events from an FCS data file. The module takes an input FCS data file and removes saturated events, i.e., events with parameter values on (or very close to) the maximum range of particular scales..
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca).
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents has the following parameters: Output FCS file name, Input FCS data file.
The RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents module helps clean flow cytometry data by removing events with extreme or maximal parameter values.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is designed to eliminate flow cytometry data points that are recorded at the maximum instrument scale, which can skew downstream analysis.
Saturated events occur when instrument voltage settings are too high, causing data points to cluster at the maximum recordable value.
The RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents module defines saturation as events within 0.1% of the maximum parameter range, effectively filtering out these potentially problematic data points.
Removing saturated events can prevent artificial clustering and improve the accuracy of subsequent flow cytometry data analysis techniques.
The module is particularly useful for researchers working with complex flow cytometry datasets where instrument calibration might have introduced measurement artifacts.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents automatically generates an output file with a "without_saturated" suffix, making it easy to track processed data.
The module provides standard output detailing which events were removed, allowing researchers to assess the extent of data filtering.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry module suite, designed to support advanced computational analysis of cytometric data.
The module can process large datasets, with estimated performance of handling 1,000,000 events with 24 parameters in under 40 seconds.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents requires Java 1.6 or higher and is compatible with GenePattern version 3.2.0 and above.
Researchers should use this module cautiously and always review the removed events to ensure no critical biological information is lost during filtering.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents module parameter descriptions:
output FCS file name | string | Specifies the name of the output FCS file | optional | Default: input filename + "without_saturated" suffix
input FCS data file | file | The source FCS file from which saturated events will be removed | required | No default value
Removal of saturated events helps prevent artificial clustering in flow cytometry data analysis
The module eliminates events with parameter values at or very close to the maximum recordable scale
Saturated events typically occur when instrument voltage is set too high
Events are considered saturated if their value is within 0.1% of the maximum range
Removing these events can improve subsequent data analysis accuracy
The module provides standard output detailing which events were removed
Careful use is recommended, as removing events may impact overall data representation
The process helps mitigate potential outliers that could skew analysis results
Module is designed for flow cytometry data processing
Supports FCS 3.0 file format with floating point data type
Handles files with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters
Requires Java 1.6 or higher for execution
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents module:
Input FCS file is a flow cytometry standard (FCS) data file containing cellular event measurements across multiple parameters.
Input FCS file contains raw flow cytometry data with potentially saturated events at maximum instrument scale values.
Input FCS file typically includes multiple cellular measurements recorded during a flow cytometry experiment.
Input FCS file can have up to 24 parameters and potentially 1,000,000 events in FCS 3.0 format.
Input FCS file uses floating point data type for parameter measurements.
Output FCS file contains flow cytometry data with saturated events removed from the original dataset.
Output FCS file name is automatically generated by appending "without_saturated" to the input filename.
Output FCS file preserves the original FCS file structure and data format.
Output FCS file has fewer total events compared to the input file due to saturated event removal.
Standard output text file provides details about removed saturated events.
Standard output includes total number of events removed.
Standard output includes percentage of events removed from the original dataset.
Standard output helps users understand the impact of saturated event filtering.
RemoveSaturatedFCSEvents is a GenePattern module designed to clean flow cytometry data by removing events with parameter values at or near the maximum recordable scale.
The module helps researchers eliminate potentially problematic data points that could skew downstream analysis by identifying events with values within 0.1% of the maximum range.
Saturated events are typically created when instrument voltage is set too high, causing event values to exceed the recordable scale.
The module automatically generates an output FCS file with saturated events removed, appending "without_saturated" to the original filename by default.
Removing saturated events can prevent artificial clustering and improve the quality of subsequent flow cytometry data analysis.
Users should carefully review the standard output, which details the number and specific events removed during processing.
The module is designed to handle large datasets, with estimated processing capabilities for files containing up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters.
Compatible with FCS 3.0 file formats and requires Java 1.6 or higher, making it versatile across different computational platforms.
The module follows the FCS 3.1 data file standard for flow cytometry, ensuring compliance with established scientific protocols.
Processing time is estimated at approximately 40 seconds for a 1,000,000 event file, with a maximum RAM requirement of 2 GB.
Researchers should use this module judiciously, understanding that event removal can impact overall data interpretation and statistical analysis.
The module is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry toolkit, designed to support advanced computational analysis of cytometric data.
