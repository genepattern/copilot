SurvivalDifference is on version .
A description of SurvivalDifference is Tests for survival differences based on cls files. Once a genomics marker or predictive model for clinical outcome is built, the next step is to test whether it really predicts outcome of new cohorts, or whether it has better predictive ability compared to already known clinical markers/predictive models. SurvivalDifference tests if there is a difference between two or more survival curves based on sample classes defined by genomic data..
SurvivalDifference is a GenePattern module written by Yujin Hoshida (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
SurvivalDifference can be categorized as Survival Analysis.
SurvivalDifference has the following parameters: input, input cls file, time field, censor field, cls field, test type, subgroup, output filename.
The SurvivalDifference module in GenePattern is a powerful tool for comparing survival curves across different sample classes in biomedical research.
The SurvivalDifference module helps researchers statistically analyze whether different groups have significantly different survival outcomes.
This module is particularly useful in cancer research, where understanding how different genetic or clinical characteristics impact patient survival is crucial.
The SurvivalDifference module can perform two primary statistical tests: the log-rank test and the generalized Wilcoxon test for comparing survival curves.
Researchers can use the SurvivalDifference module to compare survival times between groups defined by genomic data, clinical markers, or predictive models.
The module requires input files containing survival time, censoring status, and class information for each patient or sample.
SurvivalDifference allows researchers to specify specific subgroups for comparison, providing flexibility in analyzing complex datasets.
The output of the SurvivalDifference module includes a summary of statistical test results, helping researchers interpret survival differences between groups.
This module is part of the broader GenePattern platform, which provides computational tools for genomic and clinical data analysis.
The SurvivalDifference module can help validate predictive models and identify potential prognostic markers in medical research.
Researchers can use this module to test hypotheses about how different genetic or clinical characteristics might impact patient survival times.
The module supports both categorical and continuous survival data, making it versatile for various types of biomedical research.
SurvivalDifference is implemented in R, leveraging established statistical libraries for robust survival analysis.
The module can handle multiple classes and complex experimental designs, making it suitable for advanced survival analysis studies.
By comparing survival curves, researchers can gain insights into potential risk factors and prognostic indicators in disease progression.
