SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is on version v2 BETA.
A description of SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is Performs normalization and probe-level summarization to generate a SNP file for a set of Affymetrix SNP chip CEL files. The module accepts a ZIP archive containing CEL files generated using an Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip and, optionally, TXT files with SNP genotype call data..
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is a GenePattern module written by David Twomey, Joshua Gould, Marc-Danie Nazaire.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 has the following parameters: cel files, genome annotation file, normalization method, summarization method, sort by chromosome and location, include RandomGC probesets, cdf file, use mismatch probes, output prefix.
The SNPFileCreator_SNP6 module is a specialized bioinformatics tool for processing Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray data.
The SNPFileCreator_SNP6 module helps researchers preprocess raw SNP microarray data from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chips.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 can perform probe intensity normalization using techniques like Quantile Normalization to reduce systematic differences across microarray chips.
The module supports multiple probe-level summarization methods, including Median Polish, Average Difference, and PM/MM Difference Model for calculating probe set intensity values.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 generates a standardized SNP file containing raw intensity values for each allele, which can be used in downstream genetic analysis modules.
The module requires significant computational resources, typically needing at least 12GB of RAM to process SNP Array 6.0 files.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 can optionally sort SNPs by chromosome and physical location, which is useful for visualization in tools like the Integrative Genomics Viewer.
The module supports genome annotation files for human genome builds hg18 and hg19, allowing researchers to map SNP data to specific genomic locations.
Researchers can choose whether to include or exclude RandomGC probe sets in their final output using SNPFileCreator_SNP6.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is designed specifically for Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip data and is not recommended for use with earlier microarray chip versions.

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the SNPFileCreator_SNP6 module:
Input Files:
CEL files are raw intensity data files from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray chips containing probe-level measurements
Genome annotation file contains chromosome locations and probe set identifiers for mapping genetic variants
Custom CDF file optionally describes chip probe set design and sequence information for custom array configurations
Genotype call data files can be optionally included to associate genotype information with intensity measurements
Output Files:
.snp file contains allele-specific intensity values for each probe set across samples with three columns per sample
stats.txt file provides summary statistics including median, maximum, minimum, and percentile intensity values for each sample
The .snp file uses a base 1 coordinate system for genetic variant positions
The output files are designed for downstream SNP analysis and visualization in tools like Integrative Genomics Viewer

SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is a GenePattern module for processing Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip data.
The module performs normalization and probe-level summarization of CEL files from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chips.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 requires a minimum of 12GB RAM to process SNP Array 6.0 files.
The module supports two genome annotation files: UCSC hg19 and UCSC hg18.
Normalization can be performed using Quantile Normalization, which helps compensate for systematic differences across chips.
Three summarization methods are available: Median Polish (default), Average Difference, and PM/MM Difference Model.
The module can sort SNPs by chromosome and physical location, which is recommended for viewing in the Integrative Genomics Viewer.
Users can choose whether to include RandomGC probe sets in the output file.
The output includes a .snp file with raw intensity values for each allele per probe set and a stats.txt file with summary statistics.
SNPFileCreator_SNP6 is currently only supported on 64-bit Linux servers.
The module generates a GenePattern SNP file that can be used as input for other SNP 6.0 analysis modules.
Custom Chip Description Files (CDF) can be uploaded, or default files can be used.
Users can specify whether to use mismatch (MM) probes in the summarization step.
The module is based on research by Li and Wong (2001) and Beroukhim et al. (2007) on oligonucleotide array analysis.
