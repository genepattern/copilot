BWA.bwasw is on version 2.
A description of BWA.bwasw is Aligns long sequences (> 200 bp) to a sequence database using BWA 0.7.4 bwasw. It performs heuristic Smith-Waterman-like alignment to find high-scoring local hits, and can also align ~100bp reads, though slower than BWA.aln module..
BWA.bwasw is a GenePattern module written by Heng Li, Broad Institute.
BWA.bwasw can be categorized as RNA-seq, Alignment.
BWA.bwasw has the following parameters: BWA index, read file, mate read file, match score, mismatch penalty, gap open penalty, gap extension penalty, band width, min score threshold, threshold coefficient, z best heuristics, max sa interval size, min num seeds, num threads, output prefix.
The BWA.bwasw module is a specialized bioinformatics tool for aligning long DNA sequencing reads to a reference genome.
BWA.bwasw is designed to align sequencing reads longer than 200 base pairs using a heuristic Smith-Waterman-like alignment algorithm.
The module can handle both single-end and paired-end sequencing data, supporting FASTA and FASTQ file formats.
BWA.bwasw performs local alignment, which means it can find high-scoring segments within longer sequences, making it useful for detecting genomic variations and chimeric sequences.
While primarily optimized for long reads, the BWA.bwasw module can also align shorter reads around 100 base pairs, though it may be slower compared to other BWA alignment modules.
The module allows users to customize alignment parameters like match scores, mismatch penalties, and gap opening/extension penalties to fine-tune the alignment process.
BWA.bwasw can utilize multiple computational threads to improve alignment speed, though results may vary slightly between different thread configurations.
The module outputs alignment results in the standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which is widely used in genomics for representing sequence alignments.
Developed by researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute, BWA.bwasw represents a sophisticated approach to computational genomic sequence alignment.
The alignment speed of BWA.bwasw is influenced by the error rate of input sequences, performing faster with near-perfect sequence matches.
BWA index: Reference genome index file, type is BWA index, required for alignment, must be compatible with BWA 0.6.x or 0.7.x versions.
read file: Input sequence reads file, type is FASTA or FASTQ, required, can be single-end or first paired-end reads.
mate read file: Reverse reads file for paired-end data, type is FASTA or FASTQ, optional for single-end reads.
match score: Numerical score assigned to matching bases, type is numeric, determines alignment scoring.
mismatch penalty: Numerical penalty applied when bases do not match, type is numeric, impacts alignment scoring.
gap open penalty: Score deducted for initiating a gap in sequence alignment, type is numeric, controls gap formation penalties.
gap extension penalty: Additional score penalty for each base in a gap, type is numeric, controls gap elongation penalties.
band width: Alignment parameter defining search space width, type is numeric, impacts alignment accuracy and speed.
min score threshold: Minimum alignment score required for reporting, type is numeric, filters low-quality alignments.
threshold coefficient: Adjustment factor for score threshold based on query length, type is numeric, modulates alignment sensitivity.

max sa interval size: Maximum interval size for seed initiation, type is numeric, impacts alignment sensitivity.
min num seeds: Minimum number of seeds required for alignment validation, type is numeric, affects alignment confidence.
num threads: Number of computational threads used during alignment, type is numeric, can improve processing speed.
output prefix: Text string used as filename prefix for output files, type is string, required for result file naming.

BWA.bwasw is a bioinformatics module for aligning long DNA sequencing reads (>200 base pairs) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment algorithm.
The BWA.bwasw module uses a heuristic Smith-Waterman-like approach to find high-scoring local alignments between sequencing reads and a reference genome.
BWA.bwasw can align both long reads (>200 bp) and shorter reads around 100 bp, though it is slower for shorter reads compared to other BWA alignment modules.
The module requires a reference genome index file, which must be compatible with BWA versions 0.6.x or 0.7.x, and input sequencing reads in FASTA or FASTQ format.
Alignment speed in BWA.bwasw is primarily determined by the error rate of the input sequences, with faster alignment for near-perfect matches.
The module allows users to customize alignment parameters like match score, mismatch penalty, gap open penalty, and gap extension penalty.
BWA.bwasw can perform both single-end and paired-end read alignments, with the option to specify forward and reverse read files.
The alignment results are output in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, a standard file type for representing sequence alignments.
