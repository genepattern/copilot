This module can produce various plots and statistical summaries to help researchers understand the overall structure and variability of their gene expression data.
The CummeRbund.QcReport can generate box plots showing the distribution of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values across different experimental samples.
The module creates a dendrogram that illustrates the relationships between different experimental conditions based on gene expression patterns.
CummeRbund.QcReport generates density plots to help researchers visualize the distribution of log-transformed FPKM values across all samples in an experiment.
The module can produce multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots to help researchers understand the similarities and differences between experimental samples.
CummeRbund.QcReport creates principal component analysis (PCA) plots to identify the main sources of variation in gene expression data.
The module generates a dispersion plot to evaluate the quality of statistical modeling in RNA-Seq data by comparing mean counts to estimated dispersion.
CummeRbund.QcReport produces a squared coefficient of variation (SCV) plot to assess the variability between replicate measurements in an RNA-Seq experiment.
The module can create a heatmap showing pairwise similarities between experimental conditions using Jensen-Shannon distance metrics.
CummeRbund.QcReport generates text files listing differentially expressed genes, isoforms, and other genomic features that pass statistical significance thresholds.
The module is designed to work specifically with Cuffdiff output files, creating a comprehensive database for downstream analysis and visualization.

output.format (String, Optional): Specifies the file format for output visualizations and reports, with default settings for different output types.
feature.level (String, Optional): Determines the biological feature level for analysis, including genes, isoforms, transcript start sites, or coding sequences.
report.as.aggregate (Boolean, Optional): Controls whether results are reported using aggregate sample values or individual replicates, with default set to aggregate samples.
log.transform (Boolean, Optional): Determines whether FPKM values should be log transformed for visualization, with specific exceptions for certain plot types.
pca.x (Integer, Optional): Specifies which principal component to display on the x-axis of the PCA plot, must differ from pca.y.
pca.y (Integer, Optional): Specifies which principal component to display on the y-axis of the PCA plot, must differ from pca.x.
attempt.to.merge.names (Boolean, Optional): Instructs the module to attempt merging gene names into text reports when tracking IDs are present, particularly useful when using Cuffmerge merged GTF files.
Here are the input and output files for the CummeRbund.QcReport module:
