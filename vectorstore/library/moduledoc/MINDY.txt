MINDY is on version 1.0.
A description of MINDY is The MINDY (Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics) algorithm computationally infers genes that modulate the activity of a transcription factor at post-transcriptional levels. It uses mutual information (MI) to measure the mutual dependence of the transcription factor (TF) and its target gene..
MINDY is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire (Broad Institute).
MINDY can be categorized as Pathway Analysis.
MINDY has the following parameters: input.file, modulator.list, dpi.transcription.factor.list, transcription.factor, sample.percentage, conditional.mi.threshold, conditional.mi.p.value, dpi.tolerance, unconditional.mi.threshold, unconditional.mi.p.value, output.file.
The MINDY GenePattern module is a computational tool for inferring gene modulators of transcription factor interactions.
MINDY uses mutual information (MI) to analyze how genes might modulate transcription factor-target gene relationships.
The MINDY algorithm computes three key measurements: unconditional MI, conditional MI, and conditional MI difference.
MINDY helps researchers understand post-transcriptional gene regulation by identifying potential modulator genes.
The module requires input files including gene expression data, a list of potential modulator genes, and a target transcription factor.
MINDY calculates how the expression of modulator genes affects the interaction between a transcription factor and its target gene.
The algorithm can determine whether a modulator gene enhances or inhibits a transcription factor-target gene interaction.
MINDY generates a result file showing conditional mutual information differences for each target-modulator gene pair.
The module is particularly useful in studying complex gene regulatory networks in biological systems.
MINDY can help researchers identify novel regulatory relationships that are not apparent through traditional analysis methods.
The algorithm was originally developed for studying interactions in human B lymphocytes but can be applied to other biological contexts.
MINDY uses statistical thresholds to filter and validate potential gene modulators, reducing false positive results.
The module is part of the GenePattern suite, making it accessible to researchers with varying computational backgrounds.
MINDY can process large-scale gene expression datasets to systematically explore gene regulatory interactions.
The algorithm applies Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to remove indirect transcriptional interactions and improve result specificity.
MINDY module parameter descriptions:
input.file: File type (string), specifies the input data file in .res or .gct format, required for MINDY analysis.
modulator.list: File type (string), contains potential modulator genes for transcription factor interaction, more genes increase computational time, optional parameter.
dpi.transcription.factor.list: File type (string), lists annotated transcription factors for Data Processing Inequality (DPI) network reconstruction, helps remove indirect interactions.
transcription.factor: String type, specifies the specific transcription factor being analyzed in the MINDY algorithm.
sample.percentage: Numeric type (float), determines the percentage of samples used to calculate modulator gene expression states, required parameter.
conditional.mi.threshold: Numeric type (float), filters target genes based on conditional mutual information score, default is no threshold set.
conditional.mi.p.value: Numeric type (float), significance level for conditional mutual information, ranges from 0 to 1, default value is 1.
dpi.tolerance: Numeric type (float), percentage of mutual information score considered sampling error, typically between 0 and 0.15.
unconditional.mi.threshold: Numeric type (float), filters target genes based on unconditional mutual information score, default is no threshold set.
unconditional.mi.p.value: Numeric type (float), significance level for unconditional mutual information, ranges from 0 to 1, default value is 1.
output.file: String type, specifies the name of the output file in .mindy format, required parameter for storing MINDY analysis results.
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the MINDY module:
MINDY input file is a gene expression dataset in .res or .gct format containing gene expression measurements across samples.
MINDY modulator.list is a plain text file with one gene name per line, representing potential modulator genes to analyze.
MINDY dpi.transcription.factor.list is a plain text file containing gene names of known transcription factors, one per line.
MINDY input file contains gene expression data with rows representing genes and columns representing samples.
MINDY modulator.list contains candidate genes that might modulate transcription factor interactions.
MINDY dpi.transcription.factor.list helps filter indirect transcription factor interactions using Data Processing Inequality.
MINDY output file is a .mindy text file containing conditional mutual information scores between transcription factors, targets, and modulators.
MINDY output file first two lines specify the transcription factor and sample percentage used in analysis.
MINDY output file contains a matrix of conditional mutual information difference scores for each target-modulator pair.
MINDY output file scores indicate whether a modulator enhances, inhibits, or does not affect transcription factor-target interactions.
The MINDY module is a computational method for inferring gene modulators of transcription factor interactions.
MINDY uses mutual information (MI) to measure the relationship between a transcription factor and its target gene.
The MINDY algorithm calculates three key metrics: unconditional MI, conditional MI, and conditional MI difference.
Unconditional MI measures the overall mutual dependence between a transcription factor and target gene across all samples.
Conditional MI measures the mutual dependence between a transcription factor and target gene in specific subsets of samples.
Conditional MI difference quantifies how the interaction between a transcription factor and target gene changes based on modulator gene expression.
A statistically significant conditional MI difference suggests that a modulator gene influences the transcription factor-target gene interaction.
The MINDY module requires input files specifying potential modulator genes, transcription factors, and gene expression data.
Users can set thresholds for unconditional and conditional mutual information to filter results.
The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) can be applied to remove indirect transcriptional interactions.
The output is a .mindy file showing conditional MI differences for each target-modulator pair.
Positive scores indicate the modulator enhances the transcription factor-target interaction.
Negative scores suggest the modulator inhibits the transcription factor-target interaction.
The MINDY algorithm was originally developed for studying modulators of transcriptional interactions in human B lymphocytes.
The module is implemented in Java and can run on any platform with Java JVM 1.5 or higher.
