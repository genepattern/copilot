ExtractColumnNames is on version 1.0.
A description of ExtractColumnNames is Lists the sample descriptors from a .res file. This task reads the sample descriptors (ie column headers) from a .res file and produces a numbered listing of these. The numbers assigned to samples by this utility are used to specify 'column slices' in the SelectFeaturesColumns tool..
ExtractColumnNames is a GenePattern module written by Justin Lamb (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
ExtractColumnNames can be categorized as GeneListSelection.
ExtractColumnNames has the following parameters: output, input filename.
The ExtractColumnNames GenePattern module helps researchers extract and list column headers from .res files, which are common in genomic data analysis.
The ExtractColumnNames module provides a simple way to view sample descriptors in genomic datasets, enabling researchers to understand the structure of their experimental data.
By generating a numbered list of column names, ExtractColumnNames facilitates downstream analysis tasks like column selection and data subset manipulation.
The module is particularly useful for researchers working with large genomic datasets who need to quickly understand the composition and labeling of their experimental samples.
ExtractColumnNames can help biologists identify specific sample types, experimental conditions, or patient metadata within complex genomic research files.
The module serves as a preparatory tool for more advanced data processing steps in bioinformatics workflows, such as feature selection or comparative analysis.
Researchers can use the output of ExtractColumnNames to inform subsequent data filtering, subsetting, or comparative analyses in GenePattern or other bioinformatics platforms.
The ExtractColumnNames module is platform-independent, running on any operating system with Perl support, making it widely accessible to genomics researchers.
By providing a simple text output of column names, ExtractColumnNames helps researchers maintain data transparency and traceability in complex genomic research projects.
The module's simplicity makes it an essential utility for undergraduate and graduate researchers working with genomic datasets in computational biology.
ExtractColumnNames module requires an output parameter to specify the name of the output text file where column names will be listed.
ExtractColumnNames module requires an input filename parameter to specify the source .res file from which sample descriptors will be extracted.
The output parameter in ExtractColumnNames is a string representing the desired name for the output file, which will automatically have a .txt extension added.
The input filename parameter in ExtractColumnNames is a string representing the full path or filename of the .res file containing sample descriptors to be processed.
ExtractColumnNames module generates a numbered list of sample descriptors from the input .res file, which can be used for column slice selection in other tools.
The output file created by ExtractColumnNames will contain a sequential list of column headers from the source .res file.
ExtractColumnNames is designed to help users identify and enumerate sample descriptors for further data manipulation tasks.
The module supports extraction of column names across different platforms and does not have specific system requirements.
ExtractColumnNames was previously known as ExtractFeatureListColumns, indicating an evolution in the tool's naming convention.
The module is part of the GeneListSelection task type, suggesting its utility in genomic or genetic research data processing.
ExtractColumnNames module input file is a .res file containing sample descriptors or column headers.
ExtractColumnNames module input file contains data with column headers representing sample information.
ExtractColumnNames module input file is typically used in genomic or gene expression analysis workflows.
ExtractColumnNames module output file is a .txt file with a numbered list of sample descriptors.
ExtractColumnNames module output file provides a sequential listing of column names from the input .res file.
ExtractColumnNames module output file can be used to specify column slices in subsequent GenePattern analysis tools.
ExtractColumnNames module generates a human-readable text file with indexed sample names.
ExtractColumnNames module preserves the original order of column headers in the output listing.
ExtractColumnNames module creates a simple reference for identifying and selecting specific columns in genomic datasets.
ExtractColumnNames is a GenePattern module designed to extract and list column headers from a .res file.
The ExtractColumnNames module helps researchers identify and enumerate sample descriptors in genomic data files.
This module takes a .res file as input and generates a text file with a numbered list of column headers.
The output file can be used to specify column selections in other GenePattern tools like SelectFeaturesColumns.
The module was originally developed by Justin Lamb at the Broad Institute in 2003.
The module requires two parameters: an input .res filename and an output filename for the column list.
ExtractColumnNames is written in Perl and is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system.
The module is classified as a GeneList Selection task in the GenePattern workflow.
No additional support files are needed to run the ExtractColumnNames module.
The module was previously named ExtractFeatureListColumns before being renamed.
