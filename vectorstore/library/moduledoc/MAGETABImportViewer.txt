MAGETABImportViewer is on version 2.
A description of MAGETABImportViewer is A visualizer to import data in MAGE-TAB format into GenePattern. The MAGETABImportViewer imports data in MAGE-TAB format into the GenePattern .gct or .cls file formats..
MAGETABImportViewer is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
MAGETABImportViewer can be categorized as Visualization, Data Import, Microarray.
MAGETABImportViewer has the following parameters: sdrf file, data files.
The MAGETABImportViewer is a GenePattern module for importing microarray data from MAGE-TAB formatted files.
The MAGETABImportViewer allows researchers to convert complex MAGE-TAB microarray data into standardized GenePattern file formats.
The MAGETABImportViewer can generate two primary file types: .gct (expression dataset) and .cls (class label) files from MAGE-TAB data.
The MAGETABImportViewer supports importing data from major repositories like ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
The MAGETABImportViewer uses a wizard-style interface to guide users through the data import and conversion process step-by-step.
For .gct file generation, the MAGETABImportViewer allows users to select specific samples and choose appropriate quantitation types from the source data.
The MAGETABImportViewer requires a .sdrf file and data matrix files, which can be packaged together in a single .zip file for input.
When generating .cls files, the MAGETABImportViewer enables researchers to assign phenotypic or clinical classes to individual samples.
The MAGETABImportViewer supports both single-channel and two-channel microarray data import and conversion.
The MAGETABImportViewer ensures that only numerical quantitation types are selected to maintain compatibility with downstream GenePattern analysis modules.
The MAGETABImportViewer provides a flexible interface for researchers to customize their data import and transformation process.
Here's the detailed parameter description formatted for vector store ingestion:
sdrf file:
MAGE-TAB sample and data relationship file in .txt format
Required parameter for MAGETABImportViewer module
Contains metadata about experimental samples and their relationships
data files:
Compressed .zip archive containing MAGE-TAB data matrix files
Required parameter for MAGETABImportViewer module
Must include derived data matrix files referenced in the .sdrf file
Files should have matching row names to enable sample merging across multiple matrices
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the MAGETABImportViewer module:
MAGETABImportViewer input file: SDRF file is a tab-delimited text file describing sample and data relationships in MAGE-TAB format.
MAGETABImportViewer input file: Data matrix files are text files containing quantitative measurement data for microarray experiments.
MAGETABImportViewer input file: Zip archive containing SDRF and data matrix files for importing MAGE-TAB data.
MAGETABImportViewer output file: GCT file is a tab-delimited expression matrix file with gene names, sample names, and expression values.
MAGETABImportViewer output file: CLS file is a text file containing sample class labels for phenotype or clinical attribute classification.
MAGETABImportViewer supports importing microarray data from ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus repositories using MAGE-TAB format.
MAGETABImportViewer requires row names to match across multiple data matrix files for merging samples into a single GCT file.
MAGETABImportViewer allows users to select specific samples and quantitation types during the import process.
MAGETABImportViewer uses a wizard interface to guide users through file conversion and selection steps.
MAGETABImportViewer supports single-channel and two-channel microarray data import and conversion.
MAGETABImportViewer is a GenePattern module for importing microarray data from MAGE-TAB formatted files.
The MAGETABImportViewer module allows researchers to convert complex microarray data files into standardized GenePattern file formats.
MAGE-TAB is a standard file format used for storing microarray experimental metadata and data from repositories like ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus.
The module requires an .sdrf file and data matrix files compressed in a single .zip archive as input.
Users can generate two types of output files: .gct (expression dataset) and .cls (class label) files through an interactive wizard interface.
For .gct file generation, users can select specific samples and choose appropriate quantitation types representing signal or intensity values.
The .cls file generation process allows researchers to assign phenotypic or clinical labels to samples based on metadata from the original MAGE-TAB files.
The module uses a parsing library from Limpopo to process MAGE-TAB files and extract relevant experimental information.
MAGETABImportViewer supports both single-channel and two-channel microarray data processing.
The module ensures that only numerical quantitation types are selected to maintain compatibility with downstream GenePattern analysis tools.
Users can preview and modify their sample and class selections before finalizing the output files.
The wizard interface provides step-by-step guidance for importing and transforming microarray experimental data.
