SNPFileSorter is on version .
A description of SNPFileSorter is Sorts SNPs by chromosome and physical location. Sorting the SNPs is a prerequisite for using certain other tools, such as SNPViewer. The input file can be any of the following GenePattern files: .snp, .xcn, .cn, or .loh. The output file is the input GenePattern file, sorted by chromosome and physical location..
SNPFileSorter is a GenePattern module written by David Twomey, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
SNPFileSorter can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
SNPFileSorter has the following parameters: snp filename, output file.
The SNPFileSorter module is a critical tool for organizing genomic variant data by chromosomal position.
The SNPFileSorter helps researchers systematically arrange genetic variation information in a standardized format.
SNPFileSorter can process multiple genetic file types including .snp, .xcn, .cn, and .loh files containing genomic variant information.
The module automatically sorts genetic variants by chromosome and physical location, which is essential for downstream genomic analysis.
SNPFileSorter removes rows without genome location information, ensuring only mappable genetic variants are retained in the output file.
The module generates a sorted output file that can be directly used in other genomic analysis tools like SNPViewer.
SNPFileSorter is particularly useful for researchers working with large-scale genetic variation datasets across different chromosomes.
By standardizing variant positioning, the SNPFileSorter enables more accurate comparative and computational genomic analyses.
The module operates independently of specific computational platforms, making it widely accessible across different research environments.
SNPFileSorter provides detailed logging, creating stdout.txt and stderr.txt files to track which genetic variant rows were processed or excluded.
SNPFileSorter module requires an input SNP file for sorting genomic data.
SNPFileSorter input file can be .snp, .xcn, .cn, or .loh file format.
SNPFileSorter input parameter is a filename representing the genomic data file to be sorted.
SNPFileSorter input parameter is of type filename and is required.
SNPFileSorter output parameter specifies the name of the sorted output file.
SNPFileSorter output parameter allows custom naming of the sorted genomic data file.
SNPFileSorter output parameter defaults to input-file.sorted.snp if not specified.
SNPFileSorter output parameter is of type filename and is optional.
SNPFileSorter module will ignore rows without genome location information during sorting.
SNPFileSorter creates stdout.txt listing ignored rows during processing.
SNPFileSorter creates stderr.txt with error messages for ignored rows.
SNPFileSorter sorts genomic data by chromosome and physical location.
SNPFileSorter is compatible with any CPU and operating system.
SNPFileSorter is implemented in R programming language.
SNPFileSorter is designed for SNP analysis tasks in genomic research.
SNPFileSorter module input file is a GenePattern SNP file with genomic location data.
SNPFileSorter module input file can be in .snp, .xcn, .cn, or .loh format.
SNPFileSorter module input file contains genomic feature information with chromosome and physical location.
SNPFileSorter module input file rows without genome location information will be excluded from output.
SNPFileSorter module output file is the input file sorted by chromosome and physical location.
SNPFileSorter module output file preserves the original file format of the input file.
SNPFileSorter module generates a stdout.txt file listing rows that were ignored during sorting.
SNPFileSorter module generates a stderr.txt file with error messages for ignored rows.
SNPFileSorter module default output filename is input-file.sorted.snp.
SNPFileSorter module can handle multiple GenePattern SNP file formats for sorting.
SNPFileSorter is a computational genomics module designed to organize genetic variant data by chromosomal position.
The SNPFileSorter module helps researchers systematically arrange genetic variant information across different chromosomes.
This module can process multiple file types including .snp, .xcn, .cn, and .loh genetic data formats.
SNPFileSorter automatically removes rows from input files that lack genomic location information.
The module generates a sorted output file with genetic variants organized by chromosome and physical location.
By default, the output file is named with the input filename plus a ".sorted.snp" extension.
SNPFileSorter is particularly useful as a preprocessing step for downstream genetic analysis tools like SNPViewer.
The module is platform-independent and can run on any operating system or CPU architecture.
SNPFileSorter requires no manual chromosome sorting, automating a potentially time-consuming data organization task.
Researchers using SNPFileCreator to generate initial sorted .snp files do not need to re-sort their genetic variant data.
The module provides stdout.txt and stderr.txt files to track which rows were processed or ignored during sorting.
