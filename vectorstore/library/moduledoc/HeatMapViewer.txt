HeatMapViewer is on version 14.
A description of HeatMapViewer is A configurable heat map viewer that provides users with several options for manipulating and visualizing array-based data. The HeatMapViewer displays values in a heat map format where by default the largest values are displayed as the reddest (hot), the smallest values are displayed as the bluest (cool), and intermediate values are a lighter color of either blue or red..
HeatMapViewer is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire, The Broad Institute.
HeatMapViewer can be categorized as Visualization, Heatmap, Data Analysis.
HeatMapViewer has the following parameters: dataset.
The HeatMapViewer module in GenePattern is a powerful visualization tool for displaying complex genomic data in a color-coded matrix format.
The HeatMapViewer allows researchers to transform numerical data into an intuitive visual representation of gene expression patterns.
In the HeatMapViewer, larger values are typically displayed in red (hot colors), while smaller values are shown in blue (cool colors), creating an immediate visual understanding of data variation.
The HeatMapViewer supports both row-relative and global color scaling, enabling flexible visualization strategies for different types of genomic datasets.
Users of the HeatMapViewer can choose between continuous color gradients and discrete color mappings to represent data values.
The HeatMapViewer module allows researchers to add feature and sample labels using GMX and CLS files, enhancing the interpretability of complex genomic data.
With the HeatMapViewer, scientists can search for specific features or samples within the heat map, facilitating detailed data exploration.
The HeatMapViewer supports saving visualizations in SVG and PNG formats, making it easy to include heat map representations in scientific presentations and publications.
The HeatMapViewer is particularly useful for analyzing gene expression data, showing patterns of up and down-regulation across different experimental conditions.
Researchers can use the HeatMapViewer to quickly identify clusters, trends, and outliers in large-scale genomic datasets.
The HeatMapViewer's flexible color and scaling options make it adaptable to various types of array-based data beyond just gene expression.
dataset: input file type, the dataset to display in heat map format, a .gct file, required by HeatMapViewer module
HeatMapViewer requires a dataset input to generate a visual representation of data
The dataset parameter specifies the primary data source for creating the heat map visualization
Dataset must be in .gct file format to be compatible with the HeatMapViewer module
Input dataset contains the numerical values that will be transformed into color-coded heat map representation
HeatMapViewer module requires a GCT file as the primary input dataset.
The input GCT file contains numerical expression data with rows representing features and columns representing samples.
The GCT file is a tab-delimited text file with a specific header structure in the first few lines.
HeatMapViewer supports optional feature labels through a GMX file format.
The GMX file allows color-based annotation of features in the heat map visualization.
HeatMapViewer supports optional sample labels through a CLS file format.
The CLS file enables color-based annotation of samples in the heat map visualization.
The module can generate output images in SVG and PNG formats.
The output image represents the heat map visualization of the input dataset.
The heat map uses color gradients to represent numerical values, with red indicating high values and blue indicating low values.
Users can customize the color scheme through module options like global or relative color scaling.
The module supports discrete or gradient color mapping for data representation.
The heat map can be saved with configurable visual parameters like color selection and scaling method.
HeatMapViewer is a configurable visualization module for displaying array-based data in a heat map format.
The HeatMapViewer uses color intensity to represent data values, with red indicating high values and blue indicating low values.
The module allows users to choose between row-relative and global color scaling methods for converting numerical data to colors.
Users can select between continuous color gradients and discrete color mapping in the HeatMapViewer module.
The HeatMapViewer supports adding feature labels using GMX files, which can color-annotate specific features in the heat map.
Sample labels can be added to the HeatMapViewer using CLS files, allowing color-based annotation of individual samples.
The module enables saving heat map visualizations in SVG and PNG image formats with some size limitations.
HeatMapViewer provides a search functionality to find specific features or samples within the heat map.
The module is implemented using JavaScript and jQuery, making it compatible across different platforms and operating systems.
The HeatMapViewer has undergone multiple version updates to improve compatibility and fix various technical issues since its initial release.
The heat map visualization allows users to represent three-dimensional data (samples, features, and values) in a compact and visually intuitive format.
Users can customize color schemes and color selection in the HeatMapViewer to highlight different aspects of their dataset.
The module supports case-sensitive and case-insensitive searching of features and samples within the heat map visualization.
