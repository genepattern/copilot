GSEA is on version 20.4.x.
A description of GSEA is Evaluates a genome-wide expression profile and determines whether a priori defined sets of genes show statistically significant, cumulative changes in gene expression that are correlated with a phenotype..
GSEA is a GenePattern module written by Aravind Subramanian, Pablo Tamayo, David Eby; Broad Institute.
GSEA can be categorized as Gene Expression, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Bioinformatics.
GSEA has the following parameters: expression dataset, gene sets database, phenotype labels, number of permutations, chip platform.
The GSEA GenePattern module is a powerful computational tool for analyzing gene expression data by evaluating groups of genes rather than individual genes.
The GSEA GenePattern module allows researchers to perform gene set enrichment analysis on microarray or RNA-seq datasets to identify coordinated changes in gene expression.
GSEA takes two primary inputs: a gene expression dataset and a collection of predefined gene sets with biological significance, such as those from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).
The module can handle both categorical phenotypes (like tumor vs. normal) and continuous phenotypes (like gene expression levels across a time series) for comprehensive gene set analysis.
GSEA ranks all genes in a dataset based on their differential expression or correlation with a phenotype, then evaluates how genes within each gene set are distributed across this ranked list.
The enrichment score (ES) in the GSEA GenePattern module reflects the degree to which genes in a set are concentrated at the top or bottom of the ranked gene list, indicating coordinated expression changes.
Statistical significance in the GSEA GenePattern module is determined through permutation tests, where phenotype labels are randomly shuffled to create a null distribution of enrichment scores.
The module provides normalized enrichment scores (NES) that allow comparison across gene sets of different sizes, accounting for variations in gene set composition and dataset correlations.
Researchers can customize the GSEA GenePattern module's analysis by selecting different ranking metrics, permutation types, and gene set size thresholds to suit their specific research questions.
The GSEA GenePattern module generates comprehensive output, including HTML reports, heatmaps, and statistical summaries that help researchers interpret complex gene expression patterns across biological conditions.
expression dataset: File type (GCT, RES, TXT), contains gene expression data, required input for GSEA analysis.
gene sets database: File type (GMT, GMX, GRP), contains predefined sets of genes with biological meaning, required input for GSEA analysis.
number of permutations: Integer parameter, specifies statistical significance assessment iterations, default is 1000, recommended to start with 10 for initial testing.
phenotype labels: CLS file defining categorical or continuous phenotypes for samples, required input for GSEA analysis.
target profile: Name of continuous phenotype, used only for continuous phenotype CLS files, optional parameter.
collapse dataset: Boolean parameter controlling probe set collapsing to gene symbols, default is Collapse, determines how gene identifiers are processed.
permutation type: Specifies method for generating null distribution, options are phenotype (default) or gene_set, affects statistical significance calculation.
chip platform: Annotation file mapping probe identifiers to gene symbols, required when collapsing dataset, helps with gene symbol identification.
scoring scheme: Determines enrichment statistic calculation method, options include classic, weighted (default), weighted_p2, weighted_p1.5.
metric for ranking genes: Method used to score and rank genes in expression dataset, default is signal-to-noise ratio.
gene list sorting mode: Controls whether real or absolute metric values are used for gene ranking.
gene list ordering mode: Specifies ascending or descending order for gene ranking.
max gene set size: Integer parameter limiting maximum gene set size after filtering, default is 500.
min gene set size: Integer parameter limiting minimum gene set size after filtering, default is 15.
collapsing mode for probe sets: Determines how multiple probes for a single gene are collapsed, options include Max_probe (default), Median_of_probes, Mean_of_probes.
normalization mode: Method for normalizing enrichment scores across gene sets, options are meandiv (default) or None.
randomization mode: Method for phenotype label permutation, options are no_balance (default) or equalize_and_balance.

GSEA is a computational method for interpreting genome-wide gene expression data by evaluating cumulative changes in groups of genes.
GSEA focuses on analyzing sets of genes with related biological functions, rather than individual genes with the largest expression changes.
The method ranks all genes in a dataset based on their differential expression or correlation with a phenotype of interest.
GSEA calculates an enrichment score for each gene set by tracking how frequently its genes appear at the top or bottom of the ranked gene list.
The enrichment score reflects the degree to which genes in a set are overrepresented at the extremes of the gene ranking.
Statistical significance is determined through a permutation test, where phenotype labels are randomly shuffled to generate a null distribution of enrichment scores.
GSEA can analyze both categorical phenotypes (like tumor vs. normal) and continuous phenotypes (like gene expression levels across a time series).
The method helps identify coordinated changes in gene expression that might be missed by traditional single-gene analysis approaches.
GSEA uses gene sets from databases like Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or user-provided gene set collections.
The module allows customization of analysis parameters like permutation type, gene ranking metric, and gene set size filtering.
Normalized enrichment scores (NES) are calculated to enable comparison across gene sets of different sizes.
False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-values are used to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing when analyzing many gene sets.
The GSEA GenePattern module provides a computational framework for systematically exploring biological pathways and gene set behaviors in expression data.
