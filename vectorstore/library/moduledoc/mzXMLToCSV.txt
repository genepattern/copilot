mzXMLToCSV is on version .
A description of mzXMLToCSV is Converts an mzXML file to a zip file of csv files. A csv file contains one M/Z and intensity pair per line separated by a comma. mzXML is a common file format for proteomic data. GenePattern modules that accept csv files as input include ProteomicsAnalysis, CompareSpectra, and Peaks..
mzXMLToCSV is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.

input.filename: File, mzXMLToCSV module requires an input mzXML file to convert, required parameter with no default value.
input.filename: Specifies the source file for conversion from mzXML format, critical for mzXMLToCSV module processing.
input.filename: Must be a valid mzXML file containing proteomic spectral data for transformation.
output.filename: File, mzXMLToCSV module generates a zip file containing converted CSV files, required parameter with no default value.
output.filename: Defines the destination file where converted spectral data will be stored in CSV format.
output.filename: Resulting zip file will contain comma-separated spectral intensity and M/Z pair data.
mzXMLToCSV module converts an mzXML input file to a collection of CSV files.
Input file for mzXMLToCSV is a raw mzXML proteomics data file containing mass spectrometry scan information.
Input mzXML file represents complex mass spectrometry experimental data with multiple scan events and spectral measurements.
mzXML input file contains hierarchical XML-structured mass spectrometry scan data with detailed instrument and experimental metadata.
Output of mzXMLToCSV is a compressed ZIP archive containing multiple CSV files representing individual mass spectrometry scans.
Each output CSV file from mzXMLToCSV contains mass-to-charge (M/Z) and intensity values separated by a comma.
Output CSV files from mzXMLToCSV represent individual mass spectrometry scans with simplified two-column data format.
ZIP archive output from mzXMLToCSV allows easy extraction and processing of individual scan data as comma-separated files.
Converted CSV files can be directly used by other GenePattern proteomics modules like ProteomicsAnalysis and CompareSpectra.
mzXMLToCSV is a GenePattern module designed to convert complex proteomic mass spectrometry data files from mzXML format to more accessible CSV format.
The mzXMLToCSV module transforms raw mass spectrometry data into a comma-separated format that can be easily processed by other bioinformatics tools.
mzXMLToCSV takes an input mzXML file, which is a standard XML-based file format used in proteomics to store mass spectrometry experimental data.
The module generates a zip file containing multiple CSV files, where each CSV file represents a set of mass-to-charge (M/Z) and intensity measurements from the original mzXML data.
Each line in the generated CSV files contains a single M/Z and intensity pair, separated by a comma, making the data easily readable by other proteomics analysis tools.
The mzXMLToCSV module is compatible with other GenePattern proteomics modules like ProteomicsAnalysis, CompareSpectra, and Peaks.
The module is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system with Java JVM 1.4 or higher.
Developed by Joshua Gould at the Broad Institute, the mzXMLToCSV module provides a crucial data transformation step in proteomics research workflows.
The module simplifies data conversion for researchers working with mass spectrometry data, enabling easier analysis and integration with other bioinformatics tools.
