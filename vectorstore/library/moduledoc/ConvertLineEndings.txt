ConvertLineEndings is on version 1.1.
A description of ConvertLineEndings is Converts line endings to the host operating system's line endings. This task converts the line endings contained in a file to the line endings used by perl on the host operating system..
ConvertLineEndings is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
ConvertLineEndings can be categorized as Preprocess, Utility.
ConvertLineEndings has the following parameters: input.filename, output.file.
The ConvertLineEndings module helps resolve cross-platform text file compatibility issues in bioinformatics workflows.
ConvertLineEndings is a utility module that automatically adjusts text file line endings to match the host operating system's standard.
Different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) use different line ending characters, which can cause compatibility problems when sharing files between systems.
The ConvertLineEndings module is particularly useful when working with Perl-based bioinformatics tools that require consistent line ending formats.
Researchers can use ConvertLineEndings to ensure text files like sequence data, annotation files, or configuration scripts are correctly formatted for their specific computing environment.
The module supports conversion of line endings for any non-binary text file, making it a versatile preprocessing tool in genomic data analysis pipelines.
By standardizing line endings, ConvertLineEndings helps prevent potential errors or parsing issues that can arise from inconsistent file formatting across different computing platforms.
Bioinformatics workflows often involve transferring data between different systems, making the ConvertLineEndings module a critical utility for maintaining file compatibility.
The module is particularly valuable in collaborative research environments where team members might be using different operating systems and computational platforms.
ConvertLineEndings operates transparently, requiring minimal user intervention to resolve potential line ending compatibility challenges.
ConvertLineEndings module helps convert line endings across different operating systems.
input.filename: string, specifies the source file to be converted, required, represents the input file with potentially incompatible line endings.
input.filename enables specifying which file needs line ending transformation in the ConvertLineEndings module.
output.file: string, defines the destination file after line ending conversion, required, represents the output file with standardized line endings.
output.file provides the target location for the line-ending-converted file in the ConvertLineEndings module.
ConvertLineEndings module ensures compatibility of text files across different operating system environments.
The module automatically detects and transforms line endings to match the host operating system's standard.
Line ending conversion is crucial for maintaining text file readability and compatibility between different computing platforms.
Perl is the primary language used for implementing this line ending conversion process.
The module supports conversion for non-binary file formats, ensuring broad applicability across various text file types.
ConvertLineEndings module input file is a text file with potentially non-native line endings.
ConvertLineEndings module input file can be any non-binary text file format like CSV, TXT, or log files.
ConvertLineEndings module input file may have line endings from different operating systems like Windows (CRLF) or Unix (LF).
ConvertLineEndings module output file contains the same content as the input file with line endings converted to the host operating system's standard.
ConvertLineEndings module output file will use the native line ending format of the server's operating system.
ConvertLineEndings module output file preserves all original text content from the input file.
ConvertLineEndings module is designed to prepare files for Perl script execution across different operating systems.
ConvertLineEndings module ensures compatibility by standardizing line ending formats.
ConvertLineEndings module uses a support script called to_host.pl to perform the line ending conversion.
ConvertLineEndings module can handle text files from various sources and operating system environments.
The ConvertLineEndings module helps convert text file line endings to match the host operating system's line ending format.
The ConvertLineEndings module is designed to resolve line ending compatibility issues when working with Perl-based tasks.
ConvertLineEndings ensures that input files have consistent line endings across different computing environments.
This module is particularly useful when transferring text files between operating systems with different line ending conventions.
The ConvertLineEndings module takes an input file and produces an output file with standardized line endings.
ConvertLineEndings supports any non-binary file format as input, making it versatile for various text-based data processing tasks.
The module is platform-independent and can run on any CPU and operating system.
ConvertLineEndings uses a Perl script (to_host.pl) to perform the line ending conversion process.
This utility module is classified as a preprocessing and utility tool in the GenePattern workflow.
ConvertLineEndings helps researchers and bioinformaticians maintain file compatibility across different computing environments.
