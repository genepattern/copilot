Picard.MarkDuplicates is on version .
A description of Picard.MarkDuplicates is Flags duplicate reads in a SAM or BAM file. Examines aligned records in the supplied SAM or BAM file to locate duplicate reads. All records are then written to the output file with the duplicate records flagged..
Picard.MarkDuplicates is a GenePattern module written by Picard team, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
Picard.MarkDuplicates can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
Picard.MarkDuplicates has the following parameters: input.file, remove.duplicates, max.file.handles, read.name.regex, optical.duplicate.distance, sorting.collection.size.ratio, output.prefix.
Picard.MarkDuplicates is a critical bioinformatics module for identifying and managing duplicate sequencing reads.
Picard.MarkDuplicates helps researchers detect and handle duplicate reads that can arise during DNA sequencing library preparation and amplification processes.
The Picard.MarkDuplicates module examines aligned sequencing reads to identify reads that appear to be technical duplicates rather than genuine biological duplicates.
Duplicate reads in sequencing data can result from PCR amplification artifacts or optical clustering errors during library preparation, which can skew downstream genetic analysis.
Picard.MarkDuplicates uses sophisticated algorithms to compare read mapping positions, read names, and spatial coordinates to identify potential duplicate reads.
The module can either flag duplicate reads with a special marker or completely remove them from the output file, depending on user preference.
Picard.MarkDuplicates generates a metrics file that provides detailed information about the number and types of duplicate reads detected in the sequencing data.
For accurate duplicate detection, Picard.MarkDuplicates requires input files to be coordinate-sorted, which means reads are ordered by their genomic mapping position.
The module is particularly useful in whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and other high-throughput sequencing experiments where duplicate reads can introduce significant bias.
Picard.MarkDuplicates uses a configurable optical duplicate distance parameter to account for different sequencing platform pixel clustering characteristics.
The module is implemented in Java and can be used across different computational platforms, making it a versatile tool in genomic data preprocessing.

output.prefix | String | Prefix for output SAM or BAM file generated by Picard MarkDuplicates | Required | No default
Picard.MarkDuplicates input file is a coordinate-sorted SAM or BAM alignment file containing sequencing reads.
Picard.MarkDuplicates input file must follow the SAM/BAM file format specification from samtools.
Picard.MarkDuplicates input file contains aligned sequencing reads with genomic coordinate information.
Picard.MarkDuplicates output file is a SAM or BAM file with duplicate reads either flagged or removed.
Picard.MarkDuplicates output file maintains the same file format as the input file (SAM or BAM).
Picard.MarkDuplicates generates a metrics text file with detailed information about read duplication.
Picard.MarkDuplicates metrics file contains statistical data about duplicate read identification and removal.
Picard.MarkDuplicates metrics file includes information like estimated library size and duplication rates.
Picard.MarkDuplicates metrics file is a plain text file with tab-separated or space-separated values.
Picard.MarkDuplicates metrics filename follows the pattern <input.file_basename>.metrics.txt.
Picard.MarkDuplicates is a computational genomics module for identifying and managing duplicate sequencing reads.
The Picard.MarkDuplicates module helps researchers detect and handle redundant DNA sequencing reads during bioinformatics analysis.
This module examines aligned sequencing records to identify reads that appear to be duplicates, likely resulting from PCR amplification or sequencing artifacts.
Duplicate reads are identified by comparing read mapping coordinates, tile/region information, and x/y pixel coordinates from the sequencing process.
The module allows researchers to either flag duplicate reads or completely remove them from the output file, providing flexibility in downstream genomic analysis.
Users must provide a coordinate-sorted BAM or SAM file as input for the Picard.MarkDuplicates module.
The module generates two primary output files: a processed SAM/BAM file and a metrics text file documenting the duplication characteristics.
Optical duplicate detection in Picard.MarkDuplicates uses a configurable pixel distance threshold to distinguish between true and potential optical duplicates.
The module is implemented in Java and can run on any computational platform, making it widely accessible for genomic research workflows.
Researchers can customize parameters like maximum file handles and sorting collection size to optimize memory usage during duplicate marking.
The read name parsing feature allows sophisticated identification of potential duplicate reads by extracting sequencing-specific coordinate information.
Picard.MarkDuplicates is critical for improving the accuracy of downstream genomic analyses by reducing potential bias from redundant sequencing reads.
