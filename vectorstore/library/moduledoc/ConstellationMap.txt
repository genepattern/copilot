ConstellationMap is on version 1.4.x.
A description of ConstellationMap is A downstream visualization and analysis tool for gene set enrichment results with interactive web visualizer.
ConstellationMap is a GenePattern module written by Felix Wu;Broad Institute.
ConstellationMap can be categorized as Visualization, Gene Set Enrichment, Bioinformatics.
ConstellationMap has the following parameters: input gct file, input cls file, gene sets database, gene sets file, top n, direction, image format, jaccard threshold, target class.
ConstellationMap is a downstream visualization and analysis tool for gene set enrichment results that helps researchers understand complex genomic data relationships.
ConstellationMap generates an interactive web visualization that maps gene set enrichment profiles in a circular plot.
The ConstellationMap module allows researchers to explore similarities and relationships between gene sets based on their enrichment scores.
ConstellationMap uses normalized mutual information (NMI) scores to quantify the association between gene sets and phenotypic classes.
In the ConstellationMap visualization, gene sets are represented as nodes with radial distance reflecting their enrichment in a specific phenotype.
ConstellationMap can process gene set enrichment data from various sources, including ssGSEAProjection and other gene set analysis methods.
The module supports two primary workflows: one using pre-selected gene sets and another using comprehensive enrichment rankings.
ConstellationMap generates multiple output files, including an interactive HTML visualizer, static plots, and statistical reports.
The radial plot in ConstellationMap displays gene sets with angular distance proportional to the similarity of their enrichment profiles.
ConstellationMap uses the Jaccard index to represent gene overlap between sets, with edge thickness proportional to the degree of overlap.
Researchers can use ConstellationMap to explore gene set relationships across different phenotypes or experimental conditions.
The module supports both categorical and continuous phenotype data for comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis.
ConstellationMap provides an intuitive way to visualize complex gene set enrichment results, making it easier to interpret large-scale genomic datasets.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the parameters for the ConstellationMap module:
input gct file: File type (GCT), required, contains gene set enrichment data from ssGSEAProjection, with rows as gene sets and columns as sample names.
input cls file: File type (CLS), required, contains phenotype labels for samples, either categorical or continuous.
gene sets database: Drop-down menu, optional, allows selection of MSigDB gene set collections, provides access to version 5.0 collections.
gene sets file: File type (GMT or GMX), optional, allows user to upload custom gene set file not available in drop-down menu.
top n: Integer parameter, required, specifies number of top NMI-scoring gene sets to display, must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to total enriched gene sets.
direction: Drop-down menu, optional, selects correlation direction ("positive" or "negative"), default is "positive", determines how gene sets are positioned in radial plot.
image format: Drop-down menu, optional, selects output plot format (PNG or PDF), default is PNG.
jaccard threshold: Numeric parameter, optional, sets threshold for drawing edges between gene sets based on gene overlap, ranges from 0 to 1, default is 0.1.
target class: String parameter, required, specifies phenotype label to measure gene set associations, must match a label in the input CLS file.
Here are the input and output files for the ConstellationMap module:
Input Files:
Input GCT file contains gene set enrichment data with gene sets as rows and samples as columns
Input CLS file contains phenotype labels for samples in categorical or continuous format
Gene sets file in GMT or GMX format containing collections of gene sets from MSigDB or user-provided
Output Files:
Visualizer.html is an interactive JavaScript-powered radial plot for exploring gene set relationships
HEATMAP image shows top gene sets with color-coded enrichment scores and statistical metrics
REPORT text file contains calculated statistical metrics like NMI, AUC, and t-test values
CONSTELLATION_MAP static image of the radial plot showing gene set relationships
ConstellationMap.plot.data.nodes.odf contains node coordinate and metadata information
ConstellationMap.plot.data.edges.odf contains edge location and metadata information
Here are the chunks for the ConstellationMap module documentation:
ConstellationMap is a downstream visualization and analysis tool for gene set enrichment results.
The module helps identify commonalities between high-scoring gene sets by mapping their relationships.
ConstellationMap creates an interactive web visualization of gene set enrichment profile similarities.
In the visualization, gene sets are represented as nodes with radial distance reflecting positive or negative enrichment.
Member gene overlaps between sets are represented as edges, with edge thickness proportional to the degree of overlap.
The angular distance between nodes is proportional to the similarity of their enrichment profiles.
ConstellationMap uses normalized mutual information (NMI) scores to estimate gene set and phenotypic class associations.
The module can work with gene set enrichment data from various sources, including ssGSEAProjection outputs.
Users can input gene set enrichment data in GCT format and gene set collections in GMX or GMT format.
The module provides two workflow options: one using pre-selected enriched sets and another using enrichment rankings computed from the expression dataset.
ConstellationMap outputs include an interactive HTML visualizer, static plots, and statistical reports.
The visualization allows users to export overlapping gene symbols for further annotation in tools like DAVID and MSigDB.
The module uses multidimensional scaling to project gene sets onto a circular plot.
Pairwise Jaccard indices are calculated to determine gene set overlap and edge thickness in the visualization.
ConstellationMap supports both categorical and continuous phenotype comparisons.
The module can handle gene set collections with _UP and _DN suffixes, with specific parameter settings for combining sets.
