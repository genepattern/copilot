Picard.BamToSam is on version 2.
A description of Picard.BamToSam is Converts a BAM file to a SAM file. The SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) file format is a generic nucleotide alignment format that describes the alignment of query sequences or sequencing reads to a reference sequence or assembly. BAM is the binary version of the SAM format..
Picard.BamToSam is a GenePattern module written by Picard Tools.
Picard.BamToSam can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
Picard.BamToSam has the following parameters: input.file, output.prefix.
The Picard.BamToSam module is a critical tool for converting binary alignment map (BAM) files to human-readable sequence alignment map (SAM) files.
Picard.BamToSam allows researchers to transform compressed binary genomic alignment data into a text-based format that can be easily inspected and analyzed.
The module is particularly useful for bioinformaticians and genomic researchers who need to examine the details of sequencing read alignments in a more accessible format.
Picard.BamToSam supports conversion between standard genomic file formats, which is essential for compatibility across different bioinformatics software and analysis pipelines.
The conversion process preserves all original alignment information, including read sequences, mapping qualities, and alignment coordinates from the original BAM file.
Picard.BamToSam is implemented in Java, making it highly portable and compatible with multiple computational platforms and operating systems.
The module is part of the broader Picard Tools suite, which provides a comprehensive set of utilities for manipulating high-throughput sequencing data.
Researchers can use Picard.BamToSam to prepare alignment data for downstream analyses that require human-readable or text-based input formats.
The converted SAM files can be easily viewed, edited, or processed by other bioinformatics tools that may not support the compact binary BAM format.
Picard.BamToSam is particularly valuable in genomic research workflows involving next-generation sequencing data processing and analysis.
input.file:file:Picard.BamToSam module requires a BAM file as input for conversion to SAM format:input file must be a valid BAM alignment file
output.prefix:string:Picard.BamToSam module uses this parameter to generate the output SAM filename:provides a label for naming the converted file
Picard.BamToSam module converts binary BAM alignment files to human-readable SAM text format:supports standard genomic sequence alignment data transformation
Picard.BamToSam module enables researchers to transform compressed binary BAM files into more accessible SAM format:facilitates data interoperability and manual inspection of genomic alignments
Picard.BamToSam module follows SAM/BAM file specification standards:ensures compatibility with bioinformatics data processing workflows
Picard.BamToSam module supports cross-platform file conversion:works on any operating system with Java runtime environment
Picard.BamToSam module generates output files with user-specified prefix:allows customizable output file naming conventions
Picard.BamToSam input file is a binary alignment map (BAM) file containing genomic sequence alignment information.
Picard.BamToSam input BAM file stores compressed binary representation of sequence read alignments to a reference genome.
Picard.BamToSam input BAM file includes details like read sequence, mapping quality, chromosome position, and alignment flags.
Picard.BamToSam output file is a standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) text file representing genomic sequence alignments.
Picard.BamToSam output SAM file contains human-readable columns describing each sequencing read's alignment to a reference genome.
Picard.BamToSam output SAM file includes fields like read name, flag, reference chromosome, position, mapping quality, and CIGAR string.
Picard.BamToSam output SAM filename follows the pattern <output.prefix>.sam, where output.prefix is user-specified.
Picard.BamToSam conversion preserves all alignment information when transforming from binary BAM to text SAM format.
Picard.BamToSam module enables researchers to convert compressed BAM files to more easily readable SAM format for analysis.
Picard.BamToSam is a bioinformatics module that converts binary alignment map (BAM) files to sequence alignment map (SAM) files.
The Picard.BamToSam module transforms genomic alignment data from a compressed binary format to a human-readable text format.
SAM files represent the alignment of DNA sequencing reads to a reference genome, storing information about read mapping, quality scores, and genomic coordinates.
BAM files are the binary compressed version of SAM files, which are more storage-efficient but not directly readable by humans.
The Picard.BamToSam module requires two input parameters: an input BAM file and an output file prefix for naming the converted SAM file.
This module uses the SamFormatConverter function from the Picard Tools bioinformatics software suite to perform the file format conversion.
The conversion process preserves all original alignment information, including read sequences, mapping qualities, and genomic positions.
The output of Picard.BamToSam is a standard SAM file that can be easily viewed, analyzed, or processed by other genomic analysis tools.
The module is platform-independent, written in Java, and can run on any operating system with a compatible Java runtime environment.
Researchers and bioinformaticians use Picard.BamToSam when they need to inspect alignment data or prepare files for downstream analysis that requires SAM format.
