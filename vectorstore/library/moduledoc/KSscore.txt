KSscore is on version 1.0.
A description of KSscore is Computes the KS score for a set of genes within an ordered list. This task returns a numeric value ('KS score') representing the positional distribution of a set of query genes (i.e. 'tags') within an ordered list of genes..
KSscore is a GenePattern module written by Justin Lamb (Broad Institute) justin@broad.mit.edu.
KSscore can be categorized as Statistical Methods.
KSscore has the following parameters: input filename, query filename, output.
The KSscore GenePattern module is a statistical tool for analyzing gene set enrichment in ordered gene lists.
The KSscore module helps researchers identify whether a specific set of genes is concentrated at the top or bottom of a ranked gene list.
The KSscore module uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical method to compute a score representing gene set distribution.
In the KSscore module, users provide two key input files: a ranked gene list (.pol file) and a query gene set file.
The KSscore module calculates a numeric score that indicates how significantly a gene set appears at the top or bottom of a ranked list.
A high KSscore suggests that the query genes are clustered near the top or bottom of the ordered list, indicating potential biological significance.
Researchers can use the KSscore module to explore gene expression patterns, identify enriched gene sets, and discover potential functional relationships.
The KSscore module is particularly useful in genomics and transcriptomics research for understanding gene expression dynamics.
By performing permutation tests, the KSscore module can help determine the statistical significance of gene set enrichment.
The KSscore module can be applied to various biological contexts, such as cancer research, developmental biology, and comparative genomics.
The module's output includes detailed information about gene positions, scores, and statistical parameters for further analysis.
Bioinformaticians and computational biologists can use the KSscore module as part of more complex gene set enrichment workflows.
The KSscore module is platform-independent and can be run on multiple operating systems and computational environments.
input.filename: string, required, the .pol file containing the ordered list of genes with their rankings and values
query.filename: string, required, the query gene set file containing one unique identifier per line
output: string, required, name of the output file where results will be saved (a .pol extension will be automatically appended)
server: string, optional, default server for running the analysis, defaults to defaultServer

The KSscore module computes a statistical measure of gene set enrichment using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric rank statistic.
The KSscore module analyzes the positional distribution of a query gene set within an ordered list of genes.
The module requires two input files: a .pol file with a ranked gene list and a query file containing gene identifiers.
The KSscore calculates a running sum statistic that measures how concentrated the query genes are at the top of the ordered list.
A high KS score indicates that the query genes are clustered near the top of the ranked gene list.
The module can be used to assess gene set enrichment by comparing the KS score to randomized permutations of the gene list.
The KSscore is particularly useful in identifying patterns of gene expression across different experimental conditions.
The statistical method is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a non-parametric approach to comparing distributions.
The module returns multiple outputs, including a parameterized ordered list and detailed statistical reports.
The KSscore can be applied to various genomic datasets to identify meaningful gene expression patterns.
The module was developed by Justin Lamb at the Broad Institute to support gene expression analysis.
The implementation is written in Perl and can run on any computational platform with a Perl interpreter.
The KSscore method allows researchers to quantitatively assess the significance of gene set clustering within ranked lists.
The module provides flexibility in analyzing gene expression data through permutation and randomization techniques.
The KSscore can be used in various biological contexts, including cancer research and gene expression profiling.
