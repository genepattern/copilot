ReorderByClass is on version .
A description of ReorderByClass is Reorders a data file and a class file so that all samples of the same class occur together..
ReorderByClass is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
ReorderByClass can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
ReorderByClass has the following parameters: dataset.filename, class.filename, dataset.file.output.name, class.file.output.name.
The ReorderByClass GenePattern module helps researchers reorganize genomic datasets to group samples by their biological classification.
ReorderByClass allows scientists to visually and analytically align data samples that share similar characteristics or experimental conditions.
The ReorderByClass module can take various input file formats like .res, .gct, and .odf for genomic datasets.
ReorderByClass requires a corresponding class file (.cls) that defines the categorical groupings of samples in the dataset.
By reordering columns, ReorderByClass facilitates easier visual comparison and statistical analysis of samples within the same class.
The module is particularly useful for preparing data for downstream analyses like clustering, differential expression, or machine learning approaches.
ReorderByClass operates independently of specific computational platforms, running on any operating system with Java 1.4 or higher.
Researchers can use ReorderByClass to improve the interpretability of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
The module generates two output files: a reordered dataset file and a correspondingly reordered class file.
ReorderByClass supports bioinformatics workflows by providing a simple preprocessing step for organizing complex experimental data.
dataset.filename: String, input dataset file path, required, supports .res, .gct, .odf file formats in ReorderByClass module
class.filename: String, input class file path, required, used to specify class information for ReorderByClass module
dataset.file.output.name: String, output filename for reordered dataset, required, specifies destination of processed data in ReorderByClass module
class.file.output.name: String, output filename for reordered class file, required, defines where reordered class information will be saved in ReorderByClass module
ReorderByClass module helps reorganize dataset columns to group samples by their class
ReorderByClass ensures samples with same classification are positioned together in output files
ReorderByClass supports multiple input file formats for flexible data preprocessing
ReorderByClass provides utility for reorganizing complex datasets with class-based sorting
ReorderByClass operates independently of specific CPU or operating system constraints
ReorderByClass module input dataset file is a gene expression matrix with samples as columns and genes as rows.
ReorderByClass module input dataset file can be in .res, .gct, or .odf file format.
ReorderByClass module input dataset file contains numerical expression values for each gene across multiple samples.
ReorderByClass module input class file defines the class/group membership for each sample in the dataset.
ReorderByClass module input class file is in .cls file format with categorical labels for samples.
ReorderByClass module output dataset file contains the same gene expression data as input, but with columns reordered by class.
ReorderByClass module output dataset file preserves original gene and expression values, only changing column order.
ReorderByClass module output class file contains the same class labels as input, but reordered to match the new dataset column order.
ReorderByClass module output class file ensures class labels align with reordered dataset columns.
The ReorderByClass module helps researchers reorganize genomic datasets to group samples with the same biological classification together.
The ReorderByClass module allows scientists to rearrange columns in a dataset and corresponding class file to improve data visualization and analysis.
ReorderByClass takes two primary input files: a dataset file (which can be in .res, .gct, or .odf format) and a corresponding class file (.cls).
The module is designed to maintain the relationship between data points and their biological classifications during the reordering process.
ReorderByClass produces two output files: a reordered dataset file and a reordered class file that maintain their original data integrity.
This GenePattern module is platform-independent, running on any operating system and CPU architecture with Java 1.4 or higher installed.
The module is categorized as a preprocessing and utility tool, useful for data organization and preparation before more complex genomic analyses.
Researchers can use ReorderByClass to group samples by their biological characteristics, which can help in identifying patterns or trends within specific classes.
The module is developed by Joshua Gould from the Broad Institute, ensuring professional-grade data manipulation for genomic research.
ReorderByClass supports multiple dataset file formats, providing flexibility for researchers working with different types of genomic data files.
