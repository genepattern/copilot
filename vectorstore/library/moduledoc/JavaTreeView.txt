JavaTreeView is on version .
A description of JavaTreeView is Views hierarchial trees. Reads in files in Eisen's tree view format and displays hierarchial trees. At least one of gtr filename and atr filename files is required. A cdt file is always required..
JavaTreeView is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
JavaTreeView can be categorized as Visualizer.
JavaTreeView has the following parameters: cdt.filename, gtr.filename, atr.filename.
JavaTreeView is a powerful visualization tool for hierarchical clustering of biological data, particularly microarray datasets.
JavaTreeView allows researchers to explore complex gene expression patterns through hierarchical tree representations.
The JavaTreeView module can read and display genetic data files in the specialized Eisen tree view format, including CDT, GTR, and ATR file types.
JavaTreeView enables visual exploration of relationships between genes and experimental conditions by generating interactive dendrograms.
Researchers use JavaTreeView to identify clusters of genes with similar expression profiles across different experimental conditions.
The module supports visualization of large-scale genomic datasets, helping scientists detect patterns that might not be apparent in raw numerical data.
JavaTreeView provides an intuitive graphical interface for understanding the hierarchical relationships in complex biological datasets.
The module is particularly useful in microarray studies, where understanding gene co-expression and clustering can reveal important biological insights.
JavaTreeView can help researchers identify co-regulated genes, potential functional relationships, and novel gene groups within large genomic datasets.
The module is platform-independent and runs on any system with Java 1.4 or higher, making it widely accessible to biological researchers.
JavaTreeView was developed by Joshua Gould at the Broad Institute, a leading center for computational genomics research.
The module is distributed under the GNU General Public License, promoting open-source collaboration in bioinformatics research.
Researchers can use JavaTreeView to generate publication-quality visualizations of gene expression and clustering data.
The module supports multiple file types (CDT, GTR, ATR) that capture different aspects of hierarchical clustering in genetic data.
JavaTreeView helps translate complex computational clustering algorithms into visually interpretable representations of biological relationships.
cdt.filename, string, Specifies the input clustered data table file in TreeView's CDT format, required, no default value
gtr.filename, string, Specifies the gene tree file in TreeView's GTR format, optional but recommended, no default value
atr.filename, string, Specifies the array tree file in TreeView's ATR format, optional but recommended, no default value
JavaTreeView module input and output file descriptions:
cdt.filename is a clustered data table file in Eisen's TreeView format containing gene expression data organized in a tabular structure
gtr.filename is a gene tree file in TreeView format representing the hierarchical clustering of genes with branch lengths and topology
atr.filename is an array tree file in TreeView format representing the hierarchical clustering of experimental arrays or samples with branch structure
JavaTreeView requires a cdt file as mandatory input for visualization of gene expression data
JavaTreeView uses gtr and atr files to display the hierarchical clustering of genes and arrays in a tree-like visualization
The input files follow the standard Eisen TreeView file format used in microarray data analysis and visualization
JavaTreeView supports visualization of gene expression data with associated hierarchical clustering information
The module can read and display tree structures for both gene rows and array columns in a single visualization
Input files are typically generated by clustering algorithms like hierarchical clustering to represent similarity relationships in gene expression data
JavaTreeView is a visualization tool for hierarchical trees in microarray data analysis
JavaTreeView reads files in Eisen's tree view format to display complex biological data hierarchies
JavaTreeView requires at least a gene tree (gtr) or array tree (atr) file, along with a clustered data table (cdt) file
JavaTreeView was developed by Joshua Gould at the Broad Institute to help researchers visualize genomic data relationships
JavaTreeView is distributed under the GNU General Public License, ensuring open-source accessibility
JavaTreeView supports visualization across multiple computing platforms with Java JVM 1.4 or higher
JavaTreeView is based on key publications by Saldanha and Eisen about microarray data clustering and display
JavaTreeView allows researchers to explore complex hierarchical relationships in gene expression data
JavaTreeView can process three primary file types: cdt (clustered data), gtr (gene tree), and atr (array tree)
JavaTreeView provides an extensible approach to visualizing microarray data hierarchies
JavaTreeView operates independently of specific CPU architectures or operating systems
