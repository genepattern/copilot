ssGSEA is on version 10.1.x.
A description of ssGSEA is A GenePattern module for running the ssGSEA method. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) calculates separate enrichment scores for each pairing of a sample and gene set, projecting each sample within a data set onto a space of gene set enrichment scores..
ssGSEA is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern.
ssGSEA can be categorized as Projection, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
ssGSEA has the following parameters: input_gct_file, output_file_prefix, gene_sets_database, gene_symbol_column, gene_set_selection, sample_normalization_method, weighting_exponent, min_gene_set_size, combine_mode.
The ssGSEA GenePattern module transforms gene expression data into a pathway-level representation of biological activity.
The ssGSEA module calculates enrichment scores for each gene set within individual samples, providing a higher-level view of biological processes beyond individual gene expression.
ssGSEA allows researchers to characterize cell states by measuring the activity levels of biological pathways rather than focusing solely on individual gene expression levels.
The module can reduce data dimensionality by converting gene-level expression data into pathway-level enrichment scores, making downstream analysis more interpretable.
ssGSEA supports multiple normalization methods, including rank, log rank, and log transformations, to prepare gene expression data for enrichment analysis.
Researchers can use ssGSEA to project gene expression data onto predefined gene sets from databases like Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), enabling comprehensive pathway analysis.
The module allows selection of specific gene sets or can project data across all available gene sets in a chosen database, providing flexibility in analysis scope.
ssGSEA generates an output GCT file containing enrichment scores that can be used for further clustering, classification, or comparative analysis in GenePattern.
The module implements the single-sample GSEA projection methodology originally described by Barbie et al. in 2009, providing a standardized approach to pathway-level analysis.
Researchers can use ssGSEA to identify differentially active biological processes across phenotypes, potentially uncovering insights into underlying molecular mechanisms.
input gct file: File type (GCT), contains gene expression data, required for ssGSEA module analysis.
output file prefix: String type, defines prefix for output file name, optional with default being input file name with .PROJ appended.
gene sets database files: Collection of gene set definitions (GMT/GMX/GRP format), allows selection from MSigDB or custom upload, required for ssGSEA module.
gene symbol column: Integer/column name specifying which column contains gene symbol names in input GCT file, default is column 1.
gene set selection: List of gene set names to project data onto, can be specific sets or "ALL", default is ALL.
sample normalization method: Method for normalizing expression data, options include none, rank, log.rank, log, default is none.
weighting exponent: Numeric value used in enrichment score calculation, default is 0.75, recommended not to change.
min gene set size: Minimum number of genes required in a gene set for inclusion in projection, default is 10.
combine mode: Method for handling gene sets with _UP and _DN suffixes, options include combine.add, combine.replace, combine.off, default is combine.add.
Here are the input and output files for the ssGSEA GenePattern module:
Input expression dataset is a GCT file containing gene expression data with gene symbols.
Gene sets database files are GMT or GMX files containing collections of gene set definitions.
Input GCT file must have gene symbols from the same ontology or name space as the gene sets database.
Input GCT file can contain probe IDs, but may need to be collapsed to gene symbols using CollapseDataset module.
Gene sets database files can be selected from MSigDB or uploaded as custom GMT, GMX, or GRP files.
Output enrichment score dataset is a GCT file projecting the input dataset onto gene set enrichment scores.
Output GCT file can be used as input for clustering and classification algorithms in GenePattern.
Output file prefix determines the name of the output GCT file, defaulting to <input file>.PROJ.
Output file includes enrichment scores for each sample and gene set combination.
Output file can include combined enrichment scores depending on the combine mode selected.
Here are the chunks for the ssGSEA module documentation:
ssGSEA is a GenePattern module for performing single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA).
ssGSEA extends traditional GSEA by calculating separate enrichment scores for each sample and gene set combination.
The module transforms gene expression data into a space representing biological process activity levels instead of individual gene expression.
ssGSEA allows researchers to characterize cell states through the activity levels of biological pathways rather than individual gene expressions.
The module reduces data dimensionality by projecting gene expression data onto gene set enrichment scores.
ssGSEA can help identify correlations between gene set enrichment scores and phenotypes of interest.
The module implements the single-sample GSEA projection methodology described in the Barbie et al., 2009 research paper.
Input for ssGSEA requires a GCT file containing gene expression data with gene symbols matching the gene sets database.
Users can select gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or upload custom gene set files in GMT, GMX, or GRP formats.
The module offers normalization methods including none, rank, log.rank, and log transformations.
ssGSEA provides options for combining enrichment scores for gene sets with _UP and _DN suffixes.
The output is a GCT file containing the input dataset projected onto a space of gene set enrichment scores.
The default weighting exponent is 0.75, and the module authors recommend against changing this value.
ssGSEA can exclude gene sets with fewer overlapping genes than a specified minimum set size.
The module supports both human and mouse gene set databases from MSigDB.
Researchers can use the ssGSEA output for further analysis like clustering or classification of biological processes.
