ClsFileCreator is on version 4.
A description of ClsFileCreator is A tool to create a class label (CLS) file. The CLS file format defines phenotype (class or template) labels and associates each sample in the expression data with a label..
ClsFileCreator is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire(Broad Institute), Thorin Tabor (Broad Institute & UCSD).
ClsFileCreator can be categorized as File Creation, Bioinformatics, Data Preprocessing.

input.file: file type, GCT file containing dataset for class label creation, required parameter for ClsFileCreator module
ClsFileCreator module requires a specific input file format to generate class labels
Input dataset must be in GCT file format for successful class label processing
The input file is essential for defining sample phenotype or class labels
GCT file provides the source data from which class labels will be extracted or assigned
ClsFileCreator uses the input file to map samples to their corresponding phenotypic categories
ClsFileCreator module requires a GCT input file containing gene expression data.
The input GCT file must be in standard GenePattern GCT file format with sample and gene expression measurements.
ClsFileCreator generates a CLS file that defines phenotype or class labels for samples in the input dataset.
The output CLS file contains categorical labels associating each sample with a specific class or phenotype.
CLS files are typically used in machine learning and statistical analysis of gene expression data.
