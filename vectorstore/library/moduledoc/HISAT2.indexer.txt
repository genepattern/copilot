HISAT2.indexer is on version 1.
A description of HISAT2.indexer is The HISAT2.indexer generates genome indexes for the HISAT2.aligner module. HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes (as well as to a single reference genome)..
HISAT2.indexer is a GenePattern module written by Ted Liefeld.
HISAT2.indexer can be categorized as Genomics, Indexing, Alignment.
HISAT2.indexer has the following parameters: index name prefix, fasta file, gtf file, dry run.
The HISAT2.indexer module is a critical bioinformatics tool for preparing genome reference indexes for next-generation sequencing alignment.
The HISAT2.indexer generates specialized genome index files that enable rapid and accurate mapping of sequencing reads to reference genomes.
HISAT2.indexer uses an advanced algorithm based on the FM Index and Burrows-Wheeler transform to create compact, efficient genomic reference indexes.
The module can process multiple FASTA files representing different chromosomes or genomic regions to create a comprehensive reference index.
HISAT2.indexer can optionally incorporate gene annotation information from GTF files to enhance the index with splice site and exon data.
The module produces a set of 6-8 index files with .ht2 extensions that collectively represent a complete genomic reference for alignment purposes.
HISAT2.indexer allows researchers to create custom genome indexes for various organisms and genomic assemblies with high computational efficiency.
The module's underlying algorithm automatically optimizes memory usage and computational performance during index generation.
HISAT2.indexer is particularly useful for preparing indexes for RNA-seq and DNA sequencing alignment across different genomic contexts.
The module is implemented within the GenePattern platform, providing a user-friendly interface for generating genomic reference indexes.
HISAT2.indexer module requires several parameters for generating genome indexes:
index name prefix: String, required, specifies the name prefix for resulting index files and zip file.
fasta file: File, required, contains reference DNA sequences to be aligned, can be multiple FASTA files or a zip file with FASTA files.
gtf file: File, optional, contains gene annotation information about exons and splice sites.
dry run: Boolean, optional, when true prints the HISAT2 command-line without executing the alignment, useful for testing.
Each chunk focuses on a specific aspect of the HISAT2.indexer module parameter:
HISAT2.indexer requires a prefix name for generating index files.
HISAT2.indexer needs reference DNA sequences in FASTA format.
Optional GTF file provides additional genomic annotation information.
Dry run parameter allows testing the module without actual index generation.
HISAT2.indexer creates index files for genomic sequence alignment.
Index files are critical for subsequent read mapping processes.
HISAT2.indexer supports multiple input sequence files.
Prefix name determines the output index file naming convention.
GTF file can enhance index with splice site and exon information.
Dry run mode helps validate command-line configuration.
HISAT2.indexer input files:
Fasta file contains DNA reference sequences for genome indexing in FASTA format
GTF file contains optional splice site and gene annotation information in GTF format
HISAT2.indexer output files:
genome.zip contains 6-8 index files with .ht2 or .ht2l file extensions
Index files represent compressed genome reference for HISAT2 alignment
Each index file represents a different part of the genome index structure
Index files are generated using Karkkainen's blockwise algorithm
Index files are based on FM Index and Burrows-Wheeler transform
Index files replace original FASTA sequences for read alignment
Index files enable fast and sensitive genomic read mapping
HISAT2.indexer file characteristics:
Fasta input supports multiple chromosome or reference sequence files
Fasta files can be individual or compressed in a zip archive
GTF file is optional but provides additional genomic annotation
Output index files are automatically generated with specified prefix
Index files are platform-independent and can be used across different systems
Index files compress genome information for efficient computational processing
HISAT2.indexer file processing:
Indexer uses hisat2-build script to generate genome indexes
Indexer automatically optimizes memory usage and processing time
Indexer can generate standard or large (ht2l) index file formats
Indexer supports both DNA and RNA sequencing reference genome preparation
HISAT2.indexer is a GenePattern module for generating genome indexes for next-generation sequencing read alignment.
The HISAT2.indexer uses the hisat2-build script to create genomic indexes from DNA sequence FASTA files.
The module generates 6-8 index files with .ht2 or .ht2l suffixes that represent a complete genomic reference index.
HISAT2.indexer uses Karkkainen's blockwise algorithm to optimize memory usage and running time during index generation.
The index is based on the FM Index, which utilizes the Burrows-Wheeler transform for efficient genomic sequence representation.
Users must provide a name prefix for the index files and one or more FASTA files containing reference genomic sequences.
An optional GTF file can be included to add splice site and exon information to the genomic index.
The module supports a "dry run" option that allows users to preview the command-line execution without actually running the indexing process.
The output is a zip file containing the generated index files, which can be directly used with the HISAT2.aligner module.
The indexing process is implemented using a Docker container to ensure consistent computational environment and dependencies.
The module supports both DNA and RNA sequencing read alignment across human genome populations.
HISAT2.indexer is designed to be memory-efficient and can automatically select optimal settings for index generation.
The module is part of the HISAT2 alignment suite, which is known for its speed and sensitivity in genomic read mapping.
