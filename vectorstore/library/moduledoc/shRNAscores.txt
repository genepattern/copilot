shRNAscores is on version .
A description of shRNAscores is Collapses replicate array measurements and compare each cell line to a reference array. Returns a .gct file of shRNA scores per cell line..
shRNAscores is a GenePattern module written by Barbara Weir.
shRNAscores can be categorized as RNAi.
shRNAscores has the following parameters: gct, array info, reference, annotation, output prefix.
The shRNAscores GenePattern module is a computational tool for analyzing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening data.
The shRNAscores module helps researchers quantify and compare gene knockdown effects across different cell lines.
This module can generate three different scoring metrics for shRNA screening experiments: fold change, signal-to-noise ratio, and adjusted fold change.
The shRNAscores module requires three input files: a preprocessed .gct data file, an array annotation file, and an shRNA annotation file.
The module is designed to work within the GenePattern computational biology platform, enabling standardized analysis of RNAi screening data.
Researchers can use shRNAscores to compare the effects of gene knockdowns across multiple experimental conditions or cell lines.
The signal-to-noise calculation in shRNAscores helps researchers distinguish meaningful gene expression changes from background noise.
By generating multiple scoring metrics, shRNAscores provides researchers with flexible options for interpreting shRNA screening results.
The module outputs three different .gct files representing different scoring approaches: signal-to-noise, fold change, and adjusted fold change.
shRNAscores is particularly useful for large-scale functional genomics studies investigating gene function through RNA interference.
The module can handle complex experimental designs with multiple replicates and different reference conditions.
Researchers in cancer biology, developmental biology, and functional genomics can leverage shRNAscores for systematic gene knockdown analysis.
The shRNAscores module is implemented in R, making it compatible with various computational platforms and research environments.
By standardizing shRNA screening data analysis, shRNAscores helps improve reproducibility and comparability of RNAi screening experiments.

shRNAscores module allows comparing cell line arrays to a reference array
shRNAscores module generates three scoring schemes: fold change, signal to noise, and adjusted fold change
Input requires pre-processed array data with replicate measurements of shRNAs
Module calculates fold change by subtracting reference replicate sum from cell line replicate sum
Signal to noise score divides fold change by standard deviation of cell line and reference replicates
Adjusted fold change normalizes fold change by reference replicates' standard deviation
Module outputs multiple .gct files with different scoring metrics for each cell line
Module designed for RNAi screening and comparative analysis of shRNA array data
Here are the input and output files for the shRNAscores module in atomic, semantically distinct chunks:
shRNAscores input .gct data file contains pre-processed replicate arrays with shRNAs as rows and array columns.
shRNAscores array annotation file contains metadata about each array with one array per row and annotations in columns.
shRNAscores shRNA annotation file is a .chip file containing detailed information about the shRNA probes, recommended TRChuV2.chip for 55K pool.
shRNAscores signal to noise output file is a .gct format file with cell lines as columns and shRNAs as rows, containing signal to noise calculated scores.
shRNAscores fold change output file is a .gct format file with cell lines as columns and shRNAs as rows, containing fold change calculated scores.
shRNAscores adjusted fold change output file is a .gct format file with cell lines as columns and shRNAs as rows, containing adjusted fold change calculated scores.
shRNAscores sample annotation output file is a text file containing annotation information for the cell lines found in the output data files.
The shRNAscores module is a computational tool for analyzing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening data.
The shRNAscores module collapses replicate measurements from genetic screening experiments to generate comparative scores across cell lines.
The module generates three distinct scoring metrics: fold change, signal-to-noise ratio, and adjusted fold change.
Fold change in shRNAscores is calculated by subtracting the sum of reference replicates from the sum of cell line replicates.
Signal-to-noise ratio in shRNAscores is calculated by dividing fold change by the combined standard deviation of cell line and reference replicates.
Adjusted fold change in shRNAscores normalizes fold change by dividing by the reference replicates' standard deviation, with mean centering and a minimum value of 1.
The shRNAscores module requires three input files: a preprocessed .gct data file, an array annotation file, and an shRNA annotation file.
The module produces four output files: signal-to-noise data, fold change data, adjusted fold change data, and a sample annotation file.
The shRNAscores module is designed for RNAi screening analysis and can run on any computational platform with R installed.
The module was developed by Barbara Weir in August 2010 for comparative analysis of genetic screening data.
The shRNAscores module is particularly useful for researchers conducting large-scale genetic screens using shRNA libraries.
