CreateSymlinks is on version 1.
A description of CreateSymlinks is Creates symlinks to the input files in the job results directory. This is intended to be a helper module for creating scatter-gather pipelines. Note that this module is not supported on Windows..
CreateSymlinks is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire, Broad Institute.
CreateSymlinks can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
CreateSymlinks has the following parameters: input files.
The CreateSymlinks GenePattern module is a utility tool for creating symbolic links to input files in a job's results directory.
CreateSymlinks helps manage file organization in computational biology workflows, particularly in scatter-gather pipeline strategies.
The module is specifically designed for Linux and Mac operating systems, making it unsuitable for Windows-based bioinformatics environments.
CreateSymlinks allows researchers to create multiple symbolic links to input files, which can be useful for complex data processing and analysis pipelines.
The module is authored by Marc-Danie Nazaire from the Broad Institute, a leading center for computational genomics research.
CreateSymlinks serves as a preprocessing utility in GenePattern, enabling more flexible file management during bioinformatics data analysis.
The module requires at least one input file and generates symlinks in the job's output directory, facilitating easier file tracking and organization.
CreateSymlinks is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple files need to be processed or referenced in a standardized directory structure.
The module leverages symbolic linking, a Unix/Linux file system feature that creates lightweight references to original files without duplicating data.
CreateSymlinks can help reduce storage redundancy while maintaining clear file organization in complex bioinformatics computational workflows.
input_files: File, Required, Files that will be symlinked to the output directory in CreateSymlinks module
input_files represent the source files that need to be copied as symbolic links in the CreateSymlinks workflow
input_files are mandatory for the CreateSymlinks module to function correctly
input_files can be multiple files that will each receive a symlink in the job results directory
input_files must exist and be accessible to the CreateSymlinks module before symlinking occurs
input_files are typically used in scatter-gather pipeline scenarios to prepare files for downstream processing
input_files will maintain their original file paths while creating lightweight references in the output directory
input_files symlinks preserve the original file metadata and permissions in the CreateSymlinks module
input_files can include any file type supported by the underlying operating system
input_files are processed sequentially during the symlink creation process in CreateSymlinks
CreateSymlinks module creates symlinks to input files with the following characteristics:
Input Files:
One or more files of any type or format that the user wants to create symlinks for in the output directory.
Output Files:
Symlinks in the job results directory that point to the original input files, preserving the original file names and locations.
Detailed file descriptions:
CreateSymlinks module supports creating symlinks for any input file type.
Input files can be of any format: text, binary, genomic data files, images, etc.
Input files are not modified during the symlink creation process.
Symlinks maintain the original file name and path reference.
Output symlinks are created in the job results directory.
Symlinks act as references to the original files without duplicating file contents.
CreateSymlinks is designed for scatter-gather pipeline workflows.
Module is only supported on Linux and Mac operating systems.
Symlinks provide a way to organize and reference files without additional storage overhead.
Module preserves original file metadata and permissions.
