ExtractRowNames module provides flexible computational environment support
ExtractRowNames module input file is a dataset file in .res, .gct, or .odf format containing row names or feature identifiers.
ExtractRowNames module input file typically contains gene expression data with multiple columns and rows representing genes or features.
ExtractRowNames module input file must have a structured format that includes identifiable row names or accession numbers.
ExtractRowNames module output file is a plain text (.txt) file containing only the extracted row names or feature identifiers.
ExtractRowNames module output file will have a single column listing each row name from the original input dataset.
ExtractRowNames module output file preserves the original order of row names from the input file.
ExtractRowNames module supports extracting row names from three different file formats: .res, .gct, and .odf.
ExtractRowNames module requires a valid input file with consistent row name formatting for successful extraction.
ExtractRowNames module can handle various types of feature identifiers like gene accession numbers, probe IDs, or other unique row labels.
ExtractRowNames module is designed for preprocessing and preparing gene expression datasets by isolating row name information.
ExtractRowNames module helps researchers extract feature names like gene accessions from genomic datasets.
The ExtractRowNames module can process multiple file formats including .res, .gct, and .odf files.
ExtractRowNames allows users to isolate row names (typically gene identifiers) into a separate text file for further analysis.
The module requires an input filename containing the original dataset and specifies an output filename for the extracted row names.
ExtractRowNames is designed as a preprocessing utility that can work across different computational platforms and Java versions.
The module operates independently of specific CPU architectures or operating systems, providing broad compatibility.
Users of ExtractRowNames can easily extract gene accession names or other feature identifiers from genomic data files.
The output of ExtractRowNames is a simple text file containing the extracted row names, which can be used in subsequent bioinformatics workflows.
ExtractRowNames was previously known as ExtractFeatureListRows, indicating an evolution in the module's naming convention.
The module supports Java JVM level 1.4, ensuring compatibility with older computational environments in genomic research.
