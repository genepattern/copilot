AddFCSEventIndex is on version 2.
A description of AddFCSEventIndex is Adds indexes to events in a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data file. The module takes an input FCS data file and adds an index to each event as a new parameter. The index may be used identify events in different analytical processing steps, e.g., to facilitate back-gating independently of the flow cytometry analysis tools used..
AddFCSEventIndex is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
AddFCSEventIndex can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
AddFCSEventIndex has the following parameters: Input data file, Start index, Index parameter short name, Index parameter long name, Output fcs file name.
The AddFCSEventIndex module allows researchers to add unique numerical identifiers to individual events in flow cytometry data files.
The AddFCSEventIndex module helps track and annotate specific cellular events across different analytical processing steps in flow cytometry experiments.
AddFCSEventIndex enables precise event tracking by assigning incremental index numbers to each cellular measurement within a flow cytometry dataset.
The module supports customization of index parameters, allowing researchers to specify starting index values and parameter names for event identification.
AddFCSEventIndex is particularly useful for facilitating back-gating analysis, which involves tracing cellular events across multiple experimental stages or computational workflows.
The module operates on Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file formats, a standardized data format used extensively in immunology and cellular research.
AddFCSEventIndex can be applied across various research domains, including immunology, cancer research, and cellular biology, where precise event tracking is critical.
The module requires Java 1.5 or higher and is compatible with multiple operating systems and computing platforms.
AddFCSEventIndex generates a new FCS file with an additional index parameter, preserving the original data while adding a unique identifier to each cellular event.
Researchers can use the AddFCSEventIndex module to improve data reproducibility and enable more sophisticated computational analysis of flow cytometry datasets.

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the AddFCSEventIndex module:
Input FCS data file is a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file containing raw flow cytometry event data.
Input FCS data file contains multiple parameters measuring cellular characteristics for each recorded event.
Input FCS data file follows the FCS 3.1 file standard specification for flow cytometry data storage.
Input FCS data file requires no pre-processing before being used with the AddFCSEventIndex module.
Output FCS data file contains the original input file's events with a new index parameter added.
Output FCS data file maintains the same structure and parameters as the input file, with an additional index column.
Output FCS data file assigns sequential index numbers to events starting from the user-specified start index.
Output FCS data file allows tracking and identification of individual events across different analysis workflows.
Output FCS data file preserves all original measurement data from the input FCS file.
AddFCSEventIndex is a GenePattern module for adding event indexes to Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.
The AddFCSEventIndex module allows researchers to assign unique sequential indexes to individual events in a flow cytometry dataset.
The module helps researchers track and identify specific events across different analytical processing steps in flow cytometry experiments.
The AddFCSEventIndex module adds a new parameter to each event in the FCS file, incrementing the index by 1 for each event.
Users can specify a custom starting index number for the first event in the dataset, with a default value of 1.
The module allows customization of the index parameter's short name (default is "Index") and long name (default is blank).
The output is a new FCS file containing the original data with an additional index parameter assigned to each event.
The module supports any CPU type and operating system, and requires Java 1.5 or higher to run.
The AddFCSEventIndex module follows the FCS 3.1 file standard for flow cytometry data file formatting.
Version 2 of the AddFCSEventIndex module included a fix for parsing empty keyword values in FCS files.
The module was developed by Josef Spidlen and is designed to facilitate event tracking in flow cytometry analysis.
