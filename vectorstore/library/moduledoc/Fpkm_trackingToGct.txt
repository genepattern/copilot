Fpkm_trackingToGct is on version 5.
A description of Fpkm_trackingToGct is Takes a Cufflinks FPKM_tracking file and converts it to GCT format. This module converts Cufflinks FPKM_tracking format files to GCT format, which can be used as input by many other GenePattern modules..
Fpkm_trackingToGct is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Help (gp-help@broadinstitute.org).
Fpkm_trackingToGct can be categorized as RNA-seq.
Fpkm_trackingToGct has the following parameters: input file, row labels, row descriptions, filter rows, output prefix.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module is a data conversion tool for RNA-seq expression analysis in GenePattern.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module transforms Cufflinks FPKM_tracking files into the GCT file format, which is widely used in bioinformatics data analysis.
FPKM_tracking files contain RNA-seq expression values measured in Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM).
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module allows researchers to select different identifier columns for row labels and descriptions, such as Tracking ID, Gene Name, or Locus.
Non-numeric values in FPKM columns are automatically converted to NA by the Fpkm_trackingToGct module, facilitating downstream data processing.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module provides flexibility in handling RNA-seq data by allowing users to filter rows based on specific criteria.
Researchers can use the Fpkm_trackingToGct module to prepare Cufflinks RNA-seq data for further analysis in other GenePattern modules.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module supports scientific notation and zero values as output by Cufflinks, ensuring accurate data representation.
By converting FPKM_tracking files to GCT format, the Fpkm_trackingToGct module enables seamless integration with various bioinformatics analysis tools.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module is platform-independent and can be used across different computational environments.

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the Fpkm_trackingToGct module:
Fpkm_trackingToGct input file is a tab-delimited Cufflinks FPKM_tracking file containing RNA-seq expression values in Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM).
Fpkm_trackingToGct input file contains columns for Tracking ID, Nearest Reference Transcript ID, Gene Name, TSS ID, Locus, and FPKM expression values.
Fpkm_trackingToGct input file uses scientific notation for numeric expression values and can include non-numeric values like NaN.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file is a GCT format tab-delimited file containing converted RNA-seq expression data.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file includes row names selected from input file columns like Tracking ID, Gene Name, or Locus.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file includes row descriptions selected from input file columns like Locus or Gene Name.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file converts non-numeric FPKM values to NA for compatibility with other GenePattern modules.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file can be filtered to exclude rows with "-" as row labels based on module parameters.
Fpkm_trackingToGct output file name is generated using the specified output prefix parameter.
The Fpkm_trackingToGct module converts Cufflinks FPKM_tracking files to GCT format for gene expression analysis.
The module transforms RNA-seq expression data measured in Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM).
Fpkm_trackingToGct allows users to select specific columns for row labels and descriptions, such as Tracking ID, Gene Name, or Locus.
The module automatically handles non-numeric values like NaN by converting them to NA for downstream analysis.
Users can choose to filter out rows marked with a "-" in the input file, with filtering enabled by default.
The output is a GCT file, a tab-delimited format commonly used in genomic expression analysis tools like GenePattern.
Fpkm_trackingToGct supports flexible row labeling from multiple identifier columns in the original Cufflinks tracking file.
The module is written in Perl and can run on any CPU or operating system, making it widely accessible for bioinformatics researchers.
Fpkm_trackingToGct has undergone multiple version updates to improve data handling and output formatting since its initial release.
The module is specifically designed for RNA-seq data processing, bridging Cufflinks output with other genomic analysis platforms.
