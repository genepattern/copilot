FcsToCsv is on version 3.
A description of FcsToCsv is Converts a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file to a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
FcsToCsv is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
FcsToCsv can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
FcsToCsv has the following parameters: Input.FCS.data.file, Output.CSV.file.name, Use.full.names, Output.keywords.file.name, Output.keywords.mode, Channel.to.scale.conversion, Precision.
The FcsToCsv GenePattern module is a specialized tool for converting Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files into CSV format for broader data analysis.
FcsToCsv allows researchers to transform complex flow cytometry data files into a more universally readable comma-separated values format.
The module enables conversion of flow cytometry data while preserving parameter names and event information across different analytical platforms.
FcsToCsv can extract both the numerical data and associated metadata from an original FCS file, providing flexibility in downstream data processing.
By default, the module converts channel values from logarithmic to linear scale, making the data more accessible for standard statistical analysis.
Researchers can choose between short or full parameter names during the CSV conversion process using the Use.full.names parameter in FcsToCsv.
The FcsToCsv module supports optional keyword extraction, allowing users to preserve additional metadata that might not directly transfer to the CSV format.
Users can select between regular (32-bit) and double (64-bit) precision data representation when converting FCS files using the FcsToCsv module.
The FcsToCsv module is particularly useful for researchers wanting to analyze flow cytometry data in software packages that do not natively support FCS file formats.
By converting FCS to CSV, the FcsToCsv module facilitates data sharing, visualization, and analysis across different computational environments and research platforms.

Here are the input and output files for the FcsToCsv module:
Input FCS data file contains raw flow cytometry measurement data in the Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file format
Input FCS file includes multiple parameters measured for each cellular event with potential log-scaled channel values
Input FCS file stores biological measurement data typically from flow cytometry experiments
Input FCS file contains metadata keywords describing experimental conditions and instrument settings
Output CSV file contains converted flow cytometry data with events represented as rows and parameters as columns
Output CSV file uses comma-separated values format with linear-scaled parameter measurements
Output CSV file includes parameter names derived from FCS file header information
Output keywords file stores metadata extracted from the original FCS file's text segment
Output keywords file can be generated in CSV or native FCS text segment format
Output keywords file preserves experimental context and instrument configuration details not directly included in CSV data
Optional output file captures additional contextual information about the flow cytometry measurement
Conversion process transforms log-scaled channel values to linear scale by default
Conversion supports both 32-bit (default) and 64-bit floating point precision representations
Conversion maintains parameter names based on user-selected full name or short name preference
Here are the chunks for the FcsToCsv module documentation:
FcsToCsv is a GenePattern module that converts Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files to comma-separated values (CSV) files.
The module helps researchers transform flow cytometry data into a more universally accessible format for analysis in various software tools.
FcsToCsv converts FCS files by extracting data events and creating a CSV table with columns representing flow cytometry parameters.
By default, the module converts channel values from log scale to linear scale using 32-bit floating point precision.
The module allows users to specify whether to use full parameter names or short names when creating the CSV file.
Users can optionally extract and store FCS file metadata keywords in a separate file using different output formats like CSV or FCS text segment.
The conversion process preserves the original data structure, with each row representing an individual event and columns representing measured parameters.
FcsToCsv supports both regular (32-bit) and double (64-bit) precision for data conversion, with 32-bit being sufficient for most applications.
The module is platform-independent, written in Java, and can be used on any operating system with Java 1.5 or higher.
Researchers can use FcsToCsv to prepare flow cytometry data for downstream analysis in tools that may not natively support FCS file formats.
