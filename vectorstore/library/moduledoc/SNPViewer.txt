SNPViewer is on version .
A description of SNPViewer is Displays SNP data plotting copy numbers and LOH values. The SNPViewer displays SNP data with samples on the y-axis and SNP data on the x-axis. The main plot shows either copy number or LOH data, with additional features like sample information, genomic information, and sample-based plots..
SNPViewer is a GenePattern module written by Jim Robinson (Broad Institute).
SNPViewer can be categorized as Visualizer, SNP Analysis, Genomics.
SNPViewer has the following parameters: dataset filename, sample info filename, sample list filename, max memory.
The SNPViewer GenePattern module is a powerful visualization tool for analyzing SNP array data across multiple samples.
The SNPViewer allows researchers to explore genomic copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across chromosomes and samples.
The main plot of the SNPViewer displays either copy number or LOH data, with samples represented on the y-axis and genomic positions on the x-axis.
Users can load SNP data files (typically .cn or .xcn formats) created by other GenePattern modules like SNPFileCreator and CopyNumberDivideByNormals.
The sample information area allows filtering and sorting of samples based on attributes like tissue type, cell type, or other metadata included in the sample information file.
The genomic information panel displays cytobands, gene names, gene distribution, and allows users to define regions of interest for further analysis.
Users can interactively explore the data by zooming into specific chromosomal regions, hovering over data points to see detailed information, and adjusting copy number thresholds.
The color-coded heat map in the copy number view provides an intuitive visualization of genomic copy number alterations across samples.
The SNPViewer supports defining and analyzing regions of interest, allowing sorting of samples based on amplification or deletion within specific genomic regions.
The sample-based plot on the right side of the viewer provides detailed copy number information for a selected sample, showing median and individual copy number values.
Researchers can export screenshots of the visualization, filter samples, and search for specific genes or samples within the viewer.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system with Java 1.5 or higher, making it widely accessible to researchers.
