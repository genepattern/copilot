STREAM.DimensionReduction is on version .
A description of STREAM.DimensionReduction is STREAM (Single-cell Trajectories Reconstruction, Exploration And Mapping) is an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. STREAM.DimensionReduction is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to be used in the downstream analysis..
STREAM.DimensionReduction is a GenePattern module written by Huidong Chen, Massachussets General Hospital, wrapped as a module by Ted Liefeld, Mesirov Lab, UCSD School of Medicine.
STREAM.DimensionReduction can be categorized as Single-cell Analysis, Dimension Reduction, Transcriptomics.
STREAM.DimensionReduction has the following parameters: data file, output filename, percent neighbor cells, num components to keep, feature, method, num components to plot, component x, component y, figure height, figure width.
The STREAM.DimensionReduction module is a critical step in single-cell data analysis for reducing high-dimensional gene expression data to more manageable representations.
STREAM.DimensionReduction helps address the "curse of dimensionality" in single-cell transcriptomics by projecting complex cellular data into lower-dimensional spaces.
The module uses Modified Locally Linear Embedding (MLLE) as its default dimensionality reduction technique, which can transform hundreds of gene expression dimensions into just 2-3 components.
STREAM.DimensionReduction supports multiple dimensionality reduction methods, including Modified Locally Linear Embedding (MLLE), spectral embedding, UMAP, and principal component analysis (PCA).
For biological processes with simple trajectories, the STREAM.DimensionReduction module recommends using just two components to represent cellular data.
The module allows researchers to choose between using variable genes, top principal components, or all genes for the dimensionality reduction process.
STREAM.DimensionReduction generates output files that include a pickle file with the reduced dimensional representation and a standard deviation dot plot visualizing the reduced dimensions.
The module is particularly useful in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics research for exploring complex cellular differentiation and developmental trajectories.
Large datasets can be processed more efficiently by adjusting the percent neighbor cells parameter, which can significantly speed up the dimensionality reduction computation.

STREAM.DimensionReduction module input file is a STREAM pkl file containing an annotated AnnData matrix of gene expression data.
The input file is in Python pickle (.pkl) format, storing single-cell transcriptomic data with gene expression measurements.
The input file contains a matrix where each row represents a single cell and each column represents gene expression levels.
The input file includes metadata annotations about the cells, such as cell type or experimental conditions.
The input file is typically preprocessed to include only relevant genes or normalized expression values.
STREAM.DimensionReduction module output file is a new STREAM AnnData extended pickle (.pkl) file with reduced dimensionality.
The output file contains the original single-cell data projected into a lower-dimensional space using methods like Modified Locally Linear Embedding (MLLE).
The output file preserves the original cell metadata and annotations from the input file.
The output file includes the reduced dimensional representation, typically with 2-3 components by default.
The output file is designed to be used in subsequent steps of the STREAM single-cell trajectory analysis pipeline.
The module also generates a standard deviation dot plot image file showing the variation across reduced dimensions.
The dot plot image provides a visual representation of the variance captured by each reduced dimension.
The plot helps researchers understand the information retention in the dimensionality reduction process.
The image is saved with a .png file extension and uses matplotlib for visualization.
The plot can help in selecting the appropriate number of components for further analysis.
