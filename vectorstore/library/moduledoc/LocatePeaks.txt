LocatePeaks is on version 1.0.
A description of LocatePeaks is Locates detected peaks in a spectrum. This function, when used in conjunction with the Peaks module, locates peaks in spectra. The output of the Peaks module contains the result of applying digital filters. This output can be visualized using the PlotPeaks module, and converted to peak lists using LocatePeaks. LocatePeaks identifies the location of a peak based on maximum of the filtered signal, or center of area..
