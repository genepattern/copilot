GSEAPreranked is on version 7.4.x.
A description of GSEAPreranked is A GenePattern module for running the GSEA Preranked method. It runs gene set enrichment analysis against a user-supplied ranked list of genes, determining whether a priori defined sets of genes show statistically significant enrichment at either end of the ranking..
GSEAPreranked is a GenePattern module written by Chet Birger, David Eby; Broad Institute.
GSEAPreranked can be categorized as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Genomic Analysis.
GSEAPreranked has the following parameters: ranked list, gene sets database, number of permutations, collapse dataset, chip platform, scoring scheme, max gene set size, min gene set size.
The GSEAPreranked GenePattern module is a powerful computational tool for analyzing gene set enrichment across ranked genomic datasets.
GSEAPreranked allows researchers to perform gene set enrichment analysis on pre-ranked lists of genes or genomic features from various experimental platforms.
The module can analyze diverse datasets like microarray expression data, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and GWAS results by evaluating cumulative changes across predefined gene sets.
GSEAPreranked calculates an enrichment score for each gene set, reflecting how frequently gene set members appear at the top or bottom of a ranked dataset.
The module uses a statistical permutation test to assess the significance of gene set enrichment, with a recommended 1000 permutations for robust results.
Users can select gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or upload custom gene set files in GMT, GMX, or GRP formats.
GSEAPreranked provides flexible options for handling probe set data, including collapsing multiple probes to a single gene symbol and choosing different collapsing modes.
The module generates comprehensive output including enrichment reports, statistical summaries, and visualization plots to help researchers interpret complex genomic data.
Researchers can customize the analysis by selecting specific scoring schemes, setting gene set size limits, and controlling normalization methods.
GSEAPreranked is particularly useful for interpreting genome-wide datasets by connecting individual gene rankings to broader biological pathways and functional categories.

GSEAPreranked is a GenePattern module for conducting Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on pre-ranked gene lists.
GSEAPreranked allows researchers to analyze gene sets against a user-supplied ranked list of genes or genomic features.
The module can handle diverse data types like microarray expression, GWAS results, ChIP-Seq, and RNA-Seq data.
GSEAPreranked calculates an enrichment score for each gene set, reflecting how frequently gene set members appear at the top or bottom of the ranked dataset.
The module always performs permutations by gene set, which differs from standard GSEA's phenotype permutation option.
Users must ensure their ranked list contains no duplicate ranking values to prevent arbitrary gene ordering and potential result errors.
GSEAPreranked uses a weighted scoring scheme by default, incrementing a running sum statistic based on the absolute value of the ranking metric.
The module allows selection of gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or user-uploaded gene set files.
Researchers can customize analysis parameters like number of permutations, gene set size filtering, and scoring scheme.
The module generates comprehensive enrichment reports, including normalized enrichment scores and statistical significance assessments.
GSEAPreranked supports probe set collapsing and gene symbol remapping to standardize genomic feature identification.
The analysis helps interpret genome-wide data by identifying statistically significant enrichment of predefined gene sets.
