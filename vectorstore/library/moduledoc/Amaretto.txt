Amaretto is on version v00378.
A description of Amaretto is An algorithm to identify pancancer driver genes by integrating DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and gene expression data into modules..
Amaretto is a GenePattern module written by Gevaert Lab, Stanford.
Amaretto can be categorized as Cancer Research, Genomics, Bioinformatics.
Amaretto has the following parameters: expression file, copy number file, methylation file, number of modules, percent genes.
The Amaretto GenePattern module is a computational tool for identifying pancancer driver genes across multiple molecular data types.
Amaretto integrates DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and gene expression data to discover cancer-related gene modules.
The Amaretto module uses a three-step algorithmic approach to identify potential cancer driver genes and their regulatory networks.
Amaretto first identifies candidate cancer driver genes by comparing tumor genomic and epigenetic alterations to normal tissue using methods like GISTIC and MethylMix.
The Amaretto module models relationships between genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data at the individual gene level.
Amaretto creates gene expression modules that connect identified cancer driver genes with their downstream target genes using linear regression and elastic net regularization.
The Amaretto module can process data from large cancer genomics repositories like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Amaretto generates multiple output files including lists of genes, regulators, module memberships, and regulatory program data.
The Amaretto module is particularly useful for researchers studying pan-cancer gene regulation and potential cancer driver mechanisms.
Amaretto supports computational analysis of complex molecular interactions across different cancer types and molecular platforms.
The Amaretto module requires input files in GCT format for gene expression, copy number, and methylation data.
Researchers can use the Amaretto module to identify potential therapeutic targets and understand complex gene regulatory networks in cancer.

The AMARETTO module is a computational method for identifying pancancer driver genes across multiple molecular data types.
AMARETTO integrates DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and gene expression data to discover cancer-related gene modules.
The first step of AMARETTO identifies candidate cancer driver genes by comparing tumor genomic and epigenetic alterations to normal tissue using tools like GISTIC and MethylMix.
AMARETTO's second step models relationships between genomic and transcriptomic data at the individual gene level to refine cancer driver gene selection.
The third step of AMARETTO uses identified cancer driver genes to decompose global gene expression data into co-expressed gene modules with associated regulatory programs.
AMARETTO employs linear regression with elastic net regularization to model the regulatory connections between cancer driver genes and their downstream target genes.
The module supports downloading and processing TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data from the Broad Institute's Firehose platform.
AMARETTO requires input files for gene expression, copy number, and methylation data, all in GCT file format.
The module generates multiple output files including lists of genes, regulators, module memberships, and visualization plots of gene modules.
AMARETTO was developed by the Gevaert Lab at Stanford to capture genetically and epigenetically deregulated cancer driver genes across different cancer types.
The algorithm is designed to identify pancancer gene modules that may be associated with specific biological responses like smoking or antiviral mechanisms.
