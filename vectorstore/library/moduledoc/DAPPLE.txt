DAPPLE is on version .
A description of DAPPLE is Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator. DAPPLE looks for significant physical connectivity among proteins encoded by genes in loci associated with disease according to protein-protein interactions reported in the literature..
DAPPLE is a GenePattern module written by .
DAPPLE can be categorized as Protein Interaction, Network Analysis, Genomic Analysis.
DAPPLE has the following parameters: input_type, plot, regulatory_region.
The DAPPLE GenePattern module is a computational tool for analyzing protein-protein interactions in disease-associated genomic regions.
DAPPLE stands for Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator, designed to explore potential biological mechanisms underlying genetic variations.
DAPPLE can accept multiple input types including gene lists, SNPs, genomic regions, and gene-region combinations.
The module uses the InWeb database, which contains 428,430 protein interactions, to construct protein interaction networks.
DAPPLE builds direct and indirect interaction networks from proteins encoded by input genes or regions.
The module statistically assesses network connectivity using a node-label permutation method to determine significant protein interactions.
DAPPLE generates multiple output files including network statistics, seed protein scores, and genes to prioritize for further investigation.
The underlying hypothesis of DAPPLE is that causal genetic variants affect common biological mechanisms detectable through protein-protein interactions.
DAPPLE can help researchers identify potential functional connections between genes in disease-associated genomic regions.
The module uses adaptive permutation, stopping network analysis at 100 permutations if statistical significance is not achieved.
DAPPLE defines genomic regions using linkage disequilibrium data from HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project.
The tool is particularly useful for exploring potential biological mechanisms in immune-mediated and complex genetic diseases.
DAPPLE can help prioritize candidate genes within large genomic regions associated with specific diseases.
The module provides visualization of direct and indirect protein interaction networks.
DAPPLE considers high-confidence protein interactions defined by rigorous signal-to-noise thresholds.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the parameters for the DAPPLE module:
Input Type: List of genes, type is string, represents gene symbols to be analyzed in DAPPLE network, required parameter
Input Type: List of SNPs, type is string, must be from HapMap or 1KG databases, defines wingspan region around genes, required parameter
Input Type: List of genomic regions, type is string, includes region ID, chromosome, left and right boundaries, required parameter
Input Type: Gene-regions, type is string, combines gene symbols with region identifiers, allows grouping of genes, optional parameter
Plot Parameter: Boolean, determines whether network visualization is generated, default is false, optional parameter
Regulatory Region Extension: Integer, defines gene footprint extension for regulatory sequence, default is 50kb, optional parameter
Interaction Database: String, specifies protein-protein interaction source, uses InWeb database by default, not user-configurable
Permutation Threshold: Float, sets statistical significance cutoff at P < 0.1, adaptive permutation method used, default is built-in

DAPPLE is a computational method for analyzing protein-protein interactions in disease-associated genomic regions.
DAPPLE stands for Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator, designed to investigate physical connectivity among proteins encoded by disease-related genes.
The core hypothesis of DAPPLE is that causal genetic variations affect specific underlying biological mechanisms detectable through protein-protein interactions.
DAPPLE can accept four types of input: lists of genes, SNPs, genomic regions, or gene-region combinations.
The module uses the InWeb database, which contains 428,430 reported protein interactions, with 169,810 considered high-confidence interactions across 12,793 proteins.
DAPPLE builds direct and indirect interaction networks from proteins encoded by input genes and assesses network connectivity statistically.
The method uses a node-label permutation approach to evaluate the significance of protein network connections.
DAPPLE generates multiple output files, including summary statistics, network parameters, seed protein scores, and prioritized genes.
The module defines genomic regions using linkage disequilibrium data from HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project resources.
DAPPLE's most recent version uses adaptive permutation, stopping analysis at 100 permutations if network parameters do not meet significance thresholds.
The method aims to propose candidate genes in large genomic loci by analyzing protein interaction networks.
DAPPLE was originally developed to investigate protein interactions in immune-mediated disease genomic regions.
The module extends gene regions by default to include 50kb of regulatory sequence around gene footprints.
DAPPLE combines protein interaction data from multiple sources, including MINT, BIND, IntAct, and KEGG databases.
The method assigns probabilistic scores to protein interactions based on experimental context and publication frequency.
