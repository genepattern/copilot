STREAM.DetectDifferentiallyExpressedGenes is a computational method for identifying genes with significantly different expression levels between branches of single-cell trajectories.
The module uses a statistical approach to compare gene expression across different cell branches in single-cell RNA sequencing data.
STREAM.DetectDifferentiallyExpressedGenes scales gene expression values between 0 and 1 to enable standardized comparisons across different branches.
The algorithm calculates mean gene expression values for each branch and checks the fold change between these means using a default log2 fold change threshold of 0.25.
STREAM.DetectDifferentiallyExpressedGenes employs the Mann-Whitney U test to statistically evaluate differences in gene expression between branches.
For small sample sizes (less than 20 cells per branch), the module reports fold change as a qualitative measure of gene expression differences.
The module standardizes the Mann-Whitney U statistic to a Z-score, allowing comparison across different datasets with varying sample sizes.
Genes are considered differentially expressed if their Z-score or fold change exceeds a specified threshold, which defaults to 2.0.
STREAM.DetectDifferentiallyExpressedGenes generates multiple output files, including a pickle file with analysis results and PDF visualizations of differentially expressed genes.
The module is part of the STREAM pipeline, which reconstructs and explores single-cell trajectories from transcriptomic and epigenomic data.
Researchers can customize the analysis by adjusting parameters like percentile expression cutoff, z-score threshold, and the number of genes to plot.
The algorithm was developed by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and is designed to handle complex branching trajectories in single-cell data.
