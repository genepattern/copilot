DownloadURL is on version 1.0.
A description of DownloadURL is Downloads text from a URL and saves it to a file. This can be useful when a pipeline is using the same URL as input to multiple steps in the pipeline and the user only wants to retrieve the URL once. A user has the option to provide a file type by using the appropriate extension in the output file name, otherwise the file will be classified as "Other"..
