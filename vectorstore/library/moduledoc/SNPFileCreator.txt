SNPFileCreator is on version 4.
A description of SNPFileCreator is Performs normalization and probe-level summarization to generate a SNP file for a set of Affymetrix SNP chip CEL files..
SNPFileCreator is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire (Broad Institute), Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), David Twomey, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
SNPFileCreator can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
SNPFileCreator has the following parameters: cel.files, genome annotation, genome annotation file, normalization.method, summarization.method, sort.by.chromosome and location, include.RandomGC.probesets, cdf.file, use.mismatch.probes, output format, output.file.
The SNPFileCreator module is a specialized bioinformatics tool for processing Affymetrix SNP array data.
SNPFileCreator helps researchers preprocess raw SNP chip data by normalizing and summarizing probe intensity measurements.
The SNPFileCreator module supports multiple Affymetrix SNP array platforms, including Human SNP Arrays 5.0 and 6.0.
SNPFileCreator can perform quantile normalization to reduce systematic differences across different SNP chip measurements.
The SNPFileCreator module offers multiple probe-level summarization methods, including Median Polish, Average Difference, and PM/MM Difference Model.
SNPFileCreator generates standardized output files (BSNP or SNP format) that can be used in downstream genetic analysis modules.
The SNPFileCreator module requires significant computational resources, typically needing at least 6GB of RAM for processing SNP Array 6.0 files.
SNPFileCreator allows researchers to include or exclude specific probe types, such as RandomGC probesets, during data processing.
The SNPFileCreator module supports genome annotation from standard references like UCSC hg18 and hg19, or allows custom annotation uploads.
SNPFileCreator can optionally incorporate genotype call data from accompanying text files during the preprocessing workflow.
Here are the parameters described in atomic, semantically distinct chunks:
cel.files: File type is ZIP archive; contains CEL files and optional genotype call files for SNPFileCreator module; required parameter for processing SNP array data.
cel.files: Must be transferred to GenePattern server before module can process; file transfer may take considerable time due to large file sizes.
cel.files: CEL files must match Chip Description File (CDF); particularly important for custom CDFs.
genome annotation: Genome annotation file provided with SNPFileCreator module; options are UCSC hg19 and UCSC hg18.
genome annotation: Chromosome location counting starts at 1, not 0, in provided genome annotations.
genome annotation file: Custom genome information file for SNPFileCreator module; must be tab-delimited.
genome annotation file: Must contain three columns: Probe Set ID, Chromosome, and Physical Position.
normalization.method: Determines how systematic differences across chips are compensated in SNPFileCreator module.
normalization.method: Default is Quantile Normalization (dChip), which transforms probe intensity values across chips.
summarization.method: Determines how intensity values are calculated for each SNP probe set in SNPFileCreator module.
summarization.method: Default is Median Polish, an iterative method resistant to anomalous probe values.
sort.by.chromosome and location: Determines whether SNPs in output file are sorted by chromosome and physical location.
sort.by.chromosome and location: Default is to sort SNPs; useful for viewing in Integrative Genomics Viewer.
include.RandomGC.probesets: Determines whether RandomGC probe sets are included in output file.
include.RandomGC.probesets: Default is to remove RandomGC probe sets.
cdf.file: Optional parameter to use custom Chip Description File in SNPFileCreator module.
use.mismatch.probes: Determines whether mismatch (MM) probes are used in summarization step.
use.mismatch.probes: Default is to not use mismatch probes; recommended for newer SNP arrays.
output format: Determines file format for SNPFileCreator module output.
output format: Default is bsnp format, which is required for Birdseed modules.
output.file: Base name for output files generated by SNPFileCreator module.
output.file: Required parameter that determines output file naming.
Here are the input and output files for the SNPFileCreator module, formatted in atomic chunks:
Input Files:
CEL files ZIP archive contains raw intensity data from Affymetrix SNP microarray chips
Genotype call TXT files contain two columns of SNP IDs and corresponding genotype calls
Chip Description File (CDF) describes probe sequence and type information for the microarray chip
Genome annotation file contains chromosome number, physical position, and probe set ID information
Output Files:
stats.txt file contains statistical summary of SNP intensity values including median, maximum, minimum, and percentile values
BSNP file contains raw intensity values for each allele per probe set with two rows per sample representing alleles A and B
SNP file contains three columns per sample: intensity values for alleles A and B, and genotype call
File Format Details:
CEL files are raw microarray intensity data files from Affymetrix SNP chips
Genotype call files are tab-delimited text files with two columns
Genome annotation files are tab-delimited with three columns: Probe Set ID, Chromosome, Physical Position
BSNP and SNP files are formatted with intensity values relative to a base of 1
Supported Chip Types:
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 and 6.0
Human Mapping 100K Set
Human Mapping 500K Array Set
Mapping 10K 2.0 Array Set
250K Array
Here are the chunks for the SNPFileCreator module documentation:
SNPFileCreator is a GenePattern module for processing Affymetrix SNP chip CEL files.
The module performs normalization and probe-level summarization of SNP array data.
SNPFileCreator supports CEL files from multiple Affymetrix SNP array platforms, including Human SNP Array 5.0 and 6.0.
The module requires a minimum of 6GB RAM and is only supported on 64-bit Linux servers.
SNPFileCreator can apply Quantile Normalization to compensate for systematic differences across chips.
The module offers three probe-level summarization methods: Median Polish, Average Difference, and PM/MM Difference Model.
Users can choose to sort SNPs by chromosome and physical location in the output file.
The module generates a BSNP or SNP file containing intensity values per probe set for further SNP analysis.
SNPFileCreator requires a genome annotation file to map probe sets to chromosomal locations.
The module can optionally include or exclude RandomGC probe sets from the output.
Users can specify whether to use mismatch (MM) probes during the summarization step.
The output includes a stats.txt file with intensity value statistics for each sample.
SNPFileCreator supports both default and custom Chip Description Files (CDF) for chip design information.
The module can process optional genotype call files in TXT format alongside CEL files.
