CollapseDataset is on version 2.2.x.
A description of CollapseDataset is Collapses expression values from multiple input ids that map to a single target gene to a single value on a per-sample basis. CollapseDataset utilizes Probe Set ID to Gene Symbol mappings from a CHIP file to create a new data set where all probe set expression values for a given gene have been collapsed into a single expression value for each sample..
CollapseDataset is a GenePattern module written by Aravind Subramanian, Pablo Tamayo, David Eby; Broad Institute.
CollapseDataset can be categorized as Gene List Selection.
CollapseDataset has the following parameters: dataset file, chip platform, collapse mode, output.file.name, omit features with no symbol match.
The CollapseDataset module in GenePattern helps researchers consolidate multiple probe measurements for a single gene into one representative value.
CollapseDataset is a GenePattern module designed to simplify complex gene expression datasets by reducing multiple probe measurements to a single gene representation.
The CollapseDataset module supports multiple methods of collapsing probe sets, including taking the maximum, median, mean, sum, or absolute maximum expression value.
CollapseDataset uses a CHIP file to map probe set identifiers to standardized gene symbols, enabling more consistent and interpretable gene expression analysis.
The primary use of CollapseDataset is to prepare microarray or gene expression data for downstream analyses like Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
CollapseDataset helps reduce noise and potential inflation of gene set enrichment scores by consolidating multiple probes that target the same gene.
The module can handle different input file formats including GCT, RES, and GSEA-specific TXT files, providing flexibility for researchers.
CollapseDataset allows researchers to choose how multiple probes for a single gene are collapsed, with options like maximum value (default) or median value.
By default, the CollapseDataset module removes features without a gene symbol match, helping to clean and standardize gene expression datasets.
The module is particularly useful in genomics and transcriptomics research where multiple probes might exist for a single gene across different platforms.
CollapseDataset supports both human and mouse gene symbol mappings through predefined CHIP files from the MSigDB project.
Researchers can use CollapseDataset to prepare data for comparative studies, reducing technical variability introduced by multiple probe measurements.
The module is part of the broader GSEA toolkit and is implemented in Java, making it compatible with multiple computational platforms.
dataset file: File type, required input containing expression data in GCT, RES, or GSEA-specific TXT format for CollapseDataset module.
chip platform: Required dropdown selection or file upload specifying probe-to-gene symbol mapping annotations for the expression array in CollapseDataset module.
collapse mode: Required parameter determining how multiple probes for a single gene are consolidated in CollapseDataset module, with options including Max_probe (default), Median_of_probes, Mean_of_probes, Sum_of_probes, Abs_max_of_probes, and Remap_only.
output.file.name: Optional advanced parameter allowing users to rename the result file in CollapseDataset module, with default naming based on input file and collapse mode.
omit features with no symbol match: Optional advanced boolean parameter in CollapseDataset module that determines whether probes/genes without gene symbols are excluded (default true) or included in the output dataset.
CollapseDataset module requires an input expression dataset file in GCT, RES, or GSEA-specific TXT format.
The input dataset file contains gene expression measurements across multiple samples with probe set identifiers.
The input CHIP platform file defines symbol-to-gene mappings for a specific microarray or genomic platform.
The CHIP file contains mappings between probe set identifiers and corresponding HUGO gene symbols.
CollapseDataset produces a collapsed output dataset file always in GCT format.
The output GCT file contains gene expression values collapsed from multiple probes to a single gene symbol representation.
The output file uses gene symbols as identifiers instead of multiple probe set IDs.
The collapse mode determines how multiple probe values for a single gene are consolidated (max, median, mean, sum, absolute max).
The output dataset reduces probe redundancy and prepares data for downstream gene set enrichment analysis.
The output file retains the original sample columns but consolidates probe measurements per gene.
The module can optionally exclude features without gene symbol matches based on user configuration.
The CollapseDataset module is a GenePattern utility for consolidating multiple probe set measurements for a single gene into a single representative value.
The CollapseDataset module helps researchers reduce complexity in gene expression datasets by mapping multiple probe measurements to a single gene symbol.
CollapseDataset allows users to choose how multiple probe measurements are collapsed, including using maximum, median, mean, sum, or absolute maximum values.
The module requires two primary input files: an expression dataset file and a chip platform annotation file that defines gene symbol mappings.
CollapseDataset supports multiple input file formats including GCT, RES, and GSEA-specific TXT files, with output always generated in GCT format.
The collapsing process helps eliminate probe set redundancy that could potentially inflate gene set enrichment analysis scores.
By default, the module excludes probes or genes without matching gene symbols, though this behavior can be modified through an advanced parameter.
The CollapseDataset module is particularly useful for preparing gene expression data for downstream analyses like gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
The module provides multiple collapsing modes to accommodate different research needs and data characteristics, such as Max_probe, Median_of_probes, and Sum_of_probes.
CollapseDataset is built on the GSEA code base and supports common microarray platforms through pre-loaded chip annotation files from the MSigDB project.
