STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is on version .
A description of STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is STREAM (Single-cell Trajectories Reconstruction, Exploration And Mapping) is an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. This module is used to check if there is a clear meaningful trajectory pattern in the data by visualizing it using UMAP or tSNE..
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is a GenePattern module written by Huidong Chen, Massachussets General Hospital, wrapped as a module by Ted Liefeld, Mesirov Lab, UCSD School of Medicine.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization can be categorized as Single-cell Analysis, Visualization, Dimensionality Reduction.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization has the following parameters: data file, output filename, method, percent neighbor cells, perplexity, color by, use precomputed, figure height, figure width, figure legend num columns.
The STREAM.Plot2DVisualization module is a key tool for visualizing single-cell trajectory data in a two-dimensional space.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization helps researchers explore complex cellular differentiation patterns by reducing high-dimensional single-cell data to a comprehensible 2D representation.
The module can generate visualizations using two primary dimensionality reduction techniques: UMAP and t-SNE, each with unique strengths in representing cellular relationships.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization allows researchers to color cells based on different attributes like cell labels or branch identifications, providing multiple perspectives on cellular data.
The module is part of the broader STREAM pipeline for reconstructing and exploring single-cell trajectories from transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization can help researchers determine whether meaningful trajectory patterns exist in their single-cell data before proceeding with more complex analyses.
The module generates both a pickle file containing computational results and a PNG image visualizing the 2D representation of cellular data.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is particularly useful in studying complex biological processes like stem cell differentiation, developmental biology, and cellular state transitions.
Researchers can customize the visualization by adjusting parameters like figure dimensions, legend configuration, and the percentage of neighboring cells used in the projection.
The module supports both computational generation of 2D projections and the use of precomputed visualization coordinates from previous analyses.

STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is a GenePattern module for visualizing single-cell trajectory data in a 2D plane using dimensionality reduction techniques.
The module is part of the STREAM (Single-cell Trajectories Reconstruction, Exploration And Mapping) pipeline for analyzing single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization can use two primary dimensionality reduction methods: UMAP and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional single-cell data.
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a manifold learning technique based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology that preserves global data structure.
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique specifically designed for visualizing high-dimensional datasets using probabilistic approaches.
The module takes a STREAM-formatted pickle file containing an annotated AnnData matrix as input and generates a 2D visualization plot.
Users can choose between UMAP and t-SNE methods, with additional parameters like percent neighbor cells and perplexity to fine-tune the visualization.
The output includes a pickle file with the visualization results and a PNG image of the 2D plot, which can be used to assess the trajectory patterns in single-cell data.
The module is particularly useful for exploring cellular differentiation processes and understanding complex branching trajectories in single-cell datasets.
STREAM.Plot2DVisualization is designed to help researchers interactively explore and validate single-cell trajectory analysis by providing intuitive 2D visualizations.
The module was developed by Huidong Chen from Massachusetts General Hospital and wrapped for GenePattern by Ted Liefeld from the Mesirov Lab at UCSD School of Medicine.
