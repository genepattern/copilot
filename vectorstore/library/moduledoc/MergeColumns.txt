MergeColumns is on version .
A description of MergeColumns is Creates a new merged dataset from a list of datasets. Common features (rows) in the datasets are retained while others are discarded..
MergeColumns is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
MergeColumns can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
MergeColumns has the following parameters: input filename1, input filename2, zip filename, output.
The MergeColumns GenePattern module allows researchers to combine multiple datasets by matching and merging columns across different data files.
MergeColumns is useful for consolidating genomic, transcriptomic, or other biological datasets that share common identifiers.
The MergeColumns module can merge files in various formats including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, and .cls file types.
When using MergeColumns, only rows with common features across input datasets are retained in the final merged output.
The MergeColumns module automatically determines the output file format, defaulting to .gct if input files have different formats.
Researchers can use MergeColumns to combine gene expression data, copy number variation data, or clinical annotation files in a streamlined manner.
MergeColumns supports merging two files directly or can process multiple files through a zip file input.
The module is platform-independent and can run on any operating system with Java support.
Bioinformaticians use MergeColumns to integrate data from different experiments, platforms, or research studies.
MergeColumns helps researchers create comprehensive datasets by aligning and combining columns from multiple sources.
input (filename1): String type parameter. First file to merge in MergeColumns module. Specifies the initial dataset for merging. Required parameter with no default value.
input (filename2): String type parameter. Second file to merge in MergeColumns module. Specifies the additional dataset for merging. Required parameter with no default value.
zip: String type parameter. Zip file containing files to merge in MergeColumns module. Optional alternative to specifying individual input files. No default value.
output: String type parameter. Specifies the name of the merged file in MergeColumns module. Required parameter with no default value.
MergeColumns module supports merging datasets with common features while discarding non-common rows.
Supported input file formats include .res, .gct, .snp (non-allele-specific), .cn, .xcn, .odf, and .cls files.
If input files have different formats, the output file will default to GCT format.
Module is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system using Java.
MergeColumns module requires input files in various genomic data formats like .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, or .cls.
First input file for MergeColumns module must be a genomic dataset file with rows representing features and columns representing samples.
Second input file for MergeColumns module must be another genomic dataset file with compatible feature and sample structure.
Optional zip file input for MergeColumns module can contain multiple files to be merged simultaneously.
MergeColumns module output is a merged dataset file retaining common features across input files.
Output file from MergeColumns module will be in .gct format if input files have different original formats.
MergeColumns module output preserves the original data structure and values from input files.
Merged dataset from MergeColumns module will only include rows (features) that are common across all input files.
Input files for MergeColumns module should have consistent feature identification to enable accurate merging.
MergeColumns module supports merging genomic datasets with similar structural characteristics.
MergeColumns module helps researchers combine multiple genomic datasets by aligning and merging columns based on common features.
The MergeColumns module allows merging of different genomic data file types like .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, and .cls files.
MergeColumns retains only the common rows across input datasets during the merging process.
When input files have different formats, the MergeColumns module defaults to generating a .gct output file format.
The MergeColumns module is designed as a preprocessing utility for genomic data analysis.
MergeColumns requires either direct input files or a zip file containing the datasets to be merged.
The module is platform-independent, running on any CPU and operating system using Java.
MergeColumns allows researchers to consolidate multiple genomic datasets efficiently for downstream analysis.
The module automatically handles alignment and column merging across different genomic data file types.
MergeColumns provides a flexible solution for combining genomic datasets with different structures and formats.
