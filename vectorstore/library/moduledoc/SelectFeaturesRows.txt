SelectFeaturesRows is on version .
A description of SelectFeaturesRows is This module generates a file containing only a subset of features represented in the input file. The user specifies the features (i.e. 'rows') to include in the new file, and the order in which they appear, by providing a text file that contains one unique feature identifier per line..
SelectFeaturesRows is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
SelectFeaturesRows can be categorized as GeneListSelection.
SelectFeaturesRows has the following parameters: input.filename, list filename, output.
The SelectFeaturesRows GenePattern module allows researchers to extract specific rows from genomic or molecular datasets based on feature identifiers.
SelectFeaturesRows enables precise subsetting of large genomic datasets by allowing users to specify exactly which rows they want to retain.
In bioinformatics research, SelectFeaturesRows can help focus analysis on genes or features of particular interest by filtering out irrelevant data.
The module supports multiple file formats including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, and .odf, making it versatile across different types of genomic and molecular data.
Users provide a text file with feature identifiers to select, with one identifier per line, which determines which rows will be included in the output file.
SelectFeaturesRows is particularly useful in scenarios like candidate gene selection, biomarker identification, or narrowing down large-scale genomic screens.
The module preserves the original data structure while allowing researchers to create a more targeted dataset for downstream analysis.
By enabling precise row selection, SelectFeaturesRows supports more focused and efficient computational analysis in genomics and molecular biology research.
The module operates independently of specific computational platforms, running on any operating system with Java support, enhancing its accessibility.
Researchers can use SelectFeaturesRows to create custom gene lists, extract specific experimental conditions, or prepare datasets for specialized downstream analyses.
input.filename: File, input file containing data to slice, required, no default value
SelectFeaturesRows module requires an input file in .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, or .odf format
Input file must contain features or rows that can be selectively extracted
Input file serves as the source dataset for feature selection
list: File, text file specifying rows to select, required, no default value
SelectFeaturesRows module uses list to determine which features to extract
List file must contain one unique feature identifier per line
List determines the subset of rows to include in output file
List controls the order of features in the output file
output: File, output filename for selected features, required, no default value
SelectFeaturesRows module generates a new file with selected features
Output file will be in same format as input file (.res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf)
Output file contains only the rows specified in the list file
Output file preserves the original data structure and format of input file
SelectFeaturesRows module input file is a data matrix with feature identifiers in the first column.
SelectFeaturesRows module input file supports .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, and .odf file formats.
SelectFeaturesRows module requires a list file with one feature identifier per line specifying rows to extract.
SelectFeaturesRows list file is a plain text file containing unique feature identifiers.
SelectFeaturesRows output file contains only the specified rows from the input data matrix.
SelectFeaturesRows output file preserves the original file format of the input file (.res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf).
SelectFeaturesRows output file maintains the column structure of the original input file.
SelectFeaturesRows output file includes only the rows matching identifiers in the list file.
SelectFeaturesRows output file allows user-specified row order based on the list file sequence.
SelectFeaturesRows module supports extracting a subset of features from genomic and molecular data files.
SelectFeaturesRows is a GenePattern module for extracting specific rows from genomic data files
SelectFeaturesRows allows users to subset genomic data files by specifying a list of feature identifiers
The module supports multiple file formats including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, and .odf
Users provide an input file and a text file listing the specific feature identifiers they want to extract
SelectFeaturesRows enables precise selection of rows based on unique identifiers
The module is designed to work across different computational platforms and operating systems
SelectFeaturesRows is written in Java and can run on any CPU architecture
The module helps researchers focus on specific features of interest from larger genomic datasets
SelectFeaturesRows preserves the order of features as specified in the input identifier list
The module is particularly useful for targeted analysis of genomic data subsets
SelectFeaturesRows requires two primary inputs: the original data file and a list of desired feature identifiers
The output is a new file containing only the selected rows from the original dataset
This module is part of the GenePattern suite of bioinformatics data processing tools
