ExpressionFileCreator is on version 13.
A description of ExpressionFileCreator is Creates a RES or GCT file from a set of Affymetrix CEL files. For IVT arrays only; use AffySTExpressionFileCreator for ST arrays..
ExpressionFileCreator is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, David Eby.
ExpressionFileCreator can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
ExpressionFileCreator has the following parameters: input file, method, quantile normalization, background correct, compute present absent calls, normalization method, value to scale to, clm file, annotate probes, cdf file, output file.
The ExpressionFileCreator GenePattern module is a powerful tool for converting raw Affymetrix microarray data from CEL files into standardized expression matrices.
ExpressionFileCreator can transform raw microarray data using multiple computational algorithms like MAS5, RMA, GCRMA, and dChip.
The module allows researchers to convert complex Affymetrix CEL file archives into structured gene expression datasets suitable for downstream analysis.
ExpressionFileCreator supports generating output files in either GCT or RES formats, providing flexibility for different research workflows.
By using a CLM file, researchers can customize sample names, reorder columns, and add phenotypic class information to their expression matrices with the ExpressionFileCreator module.
The ExpressionFileCreator module provides options for probe annotation, allowing researchers to add gene symbol and description information to their expression data.
ExpressionFileCreator can perform quantile normalization and background correction, helping to standardize and improve the quality of microarray expression data.
Researchers can use the ExpressionFileCreator module to generate present/absent calls, providing additional insight into gene expression reliability.
The ExpressionFileCreator module is specifically designed for Affymetrix IVT arrays, with limitations on newer array types like ST arrays.
ExpressionFileCreator requires R 2.15.3 and integrates multiple bioinformatics packages to process microarray data efficiently.
input.file (File, Required): ZIP archive containing Affymetrix CEL files for analysis, must be flat with no subdirectories.
method (String, Required): Specifies the algorithm for processing CEL files, including MAS5, RMA, GCRMA, and dChip.
quantile.normalization (Boolean, Optional): Determines whether to apply quantile normalization for GCRMA and RMA methods, default is typically true.
background.correct (Boolean, Optional): Controls background correction for RMA algorithm, default is typically true.
compute.present.absent.calls (Boolean, Optional): Determines whether to generate Present/Absent calls for probe sets.
normalization.method (String, Optional): Specifies normalization method for MAS5 algorithm, such as median/mean scaling.
value.to.scale.to (Numeric, Optional): Specific value used for median/mean scaling when normalization method is applied.
clm.file (File, Optional): Tab-delimited text file mapping CEL files to sample names and phenotype classes.
annotate.probes (Boolean, Optional): Controls whether to add gene symbol and description annotations to probe sets.
cdf.file (File, Optional): Custom CDF file for alternative probe set definitions, defaults to internal CDF if not provided.
output.file (String, Required): Base name for generated output files like GCT or RES.
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the ExpressionFileCreator module:
Input ZIP file contains Affymetrix CEL files for processing in the ExpressionFileCreator module
ZIP file must be flat with no subdirectories and only contain CEL files
ZIP file should avoid special characters in filenames, using underscores instead
CLM file is an optional tab-delimited text file mapping scan names to sample names and classes in the ExpressionFileCreator module
CLM file allows reordering and selecting subset of scans from input ZIP file
CDF file is an optional custom annotation file for probe mapping in the ExpressionFileCreator module
CDF file can provide alternate probe definitions for specific array types
GCT output file contains gene expression matrix with intensity values per probe set from ExpressionFileCreator
GCT file includes gene names, descriptions, and normalized expression values
RES output file contains gene expression matrix with additional present/absent call information from ExpressionFileCreator
RES file provides more detailed probe set expression data compared to GCT
CLS output file contains sample class labels when CLM file is provided in ExpressionFileCreator module
CLS file describes phenotypic classes for samples in expression dataset
ExpressionFileCreator is a GenePattern module for converting Affymetrix CEL files into standardized gene expression matrices.
The ExpressionFileCreator module processes raw Affymetrix microarray data from CEL files into normalized expression datasets.
This module supports multiple expression normalization algorithms including MAS5, RMA, GCRMA, and dChip for processing microarray data.
The module can generate either GCT or RES file formats containing gene expression intensity values for each probe set.
Users can provide an optional CLM file to customize sample names, reorder columns, and add phenotype class information to the output.
The module works specifically with Illumina IVT arrays and does not support newer Affymetrix ST arrays or exon arrays.
ExpressionFileCreator requires R 2.15.3 and several specialized bioinformatics R packages for microarray data processing.
The module can optionally annotate probes with gene symbols and descriptions during the expression file creation process.
Quantile normalization can be applied to RMA and GCRMA algorithms to standardize expression data across multiple samples.
Background correction is available for RMA algorithm to reduce technical variation in microarray signal intensity measurements.
The module can compute Present/Absent calls to indicate the reliability of gene expression measurements for each probe set.
ExpressionFileCreator removes log2 transformation from GCRMA and RMA algorithms before generating the final expression file.
Users must provide a flat ZIP file containing CEL files, with no subdirectories or additional file types included.
