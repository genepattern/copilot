HierarchicalClusteringViewer is on version 12.
A description of HierarchicalClusteringViewer is Views results of hierarchical clustering. This visualizer provides a tree view (dendrogram) of the results of the HierarchicalClustering module. The dendrogram provides a graphical view of the distance between clusters identified by the algorithm, as well as a heat map of the associated data..
HierarchicalClusteringViewer is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire, Broad Institute.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer can be categorized as Visualization, Clustering.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer has the following parameters: cdt file, gtr file, atr file.
The HierarchicalClusteringViewer module is a powerful visualization tool for exploring complex biological datasets through hierarchical clustering.
The HierarchicalClusteringViewer helps researchers understand relationships and patterns within gene expression data by creating visual representations of clustered data.
The module generates a dendrogram that graphically displays the distances between different clusters in a dataset, allowing scientists to identify similarities and differences across genes or samples.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer can create heat maps that represent data values using color intensity, with red typically indicating higher values and blue indicating lower values.
The module supports both row-relative and global color scaling methods, enabling researchers to customize how data values are transformed into visual representations.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer allows users to rotate dendrograms and explore cluster relationships by flipping branches, providing interactive data exploration capabilities.
The module can perform biclustering by simultaneously clustering both rows (genes) and columns (samples), revealing complex multidimensional relationships in biological datasets.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer supports additional annotation features like feature and sample labels, which can be added using specialized file formats to provide more context to the visualization.
Users of the HierarchicalClusteringViewer can save their visualizations in SVG and PNG formats, facilitating easy integration of clustering results into scientific presentations and publications.
The module is particularly useful in genomics, transcriptomics, and other fields where understanding complex relationships within large datasets is crucial for scientific discovery.
cdt file, file, HierarchicalClusteringViewer requires clustered data table containing original data reordered into clusters, required parameter
gtr file, file, HierarchicalClusteringViewer contains distance measures between gene (row) clusters, at least one of gtr or atr file is required
atr file, file, HierarchicalClusteringViewer contains distance measures between sample (column) clusters, at least one of gtr or atr file is required
HierarchicalClusteringViewer requires three primary input files from the HierarchicalClustering module.
CDT file contains the original clustered data table with rows and columns reordered based on clustering results.
GTR file records the hierarchical clustering order and distance measures for gene (row) clusters.
ATR file records the hierarchical clustering order and distance measures for sample (column) clusters.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer supports optional GMX files for feature label annotations.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer supports optional CLS files for sample label annotations.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer can output heat map images in SVG and PNG formats.
The CDT file is a tab-delimited text file containing numerical data with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
The GTR file contains a hierarchical tree structure representing gene clustering relationships and distances.
The ATR file contains a hierarchical tree structure representing sample clustering relationships and distances.
The GMX file is a text file defining feature sets with labels and optional color annotations.
The CLS file is a text file defining sample classifications with optional color annotations.
The output PNG/SVG image represents the clustered heat map with optional feature and sample labels.
The HierarchicalClusteringViewer module visualizes results from hierarchical clustering analysis.
The module generates a dendrogram showing the hierarchical relationships between clusters in a dataset.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer requires three potential input files: a CDT file with clustered data, a GTR file with gene cluster distances, and an ATR file with sample cluster distances.
The module creates a heat map representation of the data, with color intensity representing value magnitudes across the dataset.
Users can choose between row-relative and global color scaling methods in the HierarchicalClusteringViewer.
The heat map can use either a continuous color gradient or discrete color mapping in the HierarchicalClusteringViewer.
HierarchicalClusteringViewer allows users to rotate dendrogram branches by right-clicking on cluster nodes.
The module supports adding feature and sample labels through GMX and CLS files respectively.
Users can save heat map visualizations from the HierarchicalClusteringViewer in SVG or PNG formats.
The HierarchicalClusteringViewer includes a search function to locate specific features or samples within the heat map.
The module is platform-independent and runs using JavaScript and Java technologies.
