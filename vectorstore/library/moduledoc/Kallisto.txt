Kallisto is on version 2.0.
A description of Kallisto is An implementation of Kallisto, intended to be used for RNA quantitation against a human index, Gencode release 37 (GRCh38.p13), or a mouse index, Gencode release M26 (GRCm39)..
Kallisto is a GenePattern module written by Edwin Juarez, Thorin Tabor.
Kallisto can be categorized as RNA Quantification, Transcriptomics.
Kallisto has the following parameters: fastq.files, transcriptome, bias, include.overhang, read.direction, output.filename, bootstrap.samples, seed, quantify.reads, fragment.length, fragment.sd, pseudobam, genomebam, gtf.file, chromosome.file.
The Kallisto GenePattern module is a powerful tool for RNA-seq quantification and transcript abundance estimation.
Kallisto enables precise pseudoalignment of RNA sequencing reads to reference transcriptomes for human and mouse genomic data.
The module can perform sequence-based bias correction during read alignment, improving quantification accuracy.
Kallisto supports both single-end and paired-end RNA sequencing data, with flexible parameters for fragment length and standard deviation estimation.
Users can generate transcript-level abundance estimates in multiple file formats, including H5, TSV, and CSV, facilitating downstream analysis.
The module provides bootstrap sampling to estimate uncertainty in transcript quantification, with a default of 2 bootstrap samples.
Kallisto can generate normalized gene-level and raw estimated count data, supporting various downstream transcriptomic analyses.
The module integrates with Sleuth for gene-level aggregation and provides options for generating pseudoalignment BAM files.
Researchers can specify strand-specific read directions and perform quantification with customizable parameters like seed value and bias correction.
The Kallisto GenePattern module supports both human (Gencode release 37) and mouse (Gencode release M26) transcriptome indices.
Output files include detailed abundance estimates, run information, and log files to support comprehensive RNA-seq data interpretation.
The module is particularly useful for researchers studying gene expression, transcript isoforms, and quantitative transcriptomics.

Kallisto is a computational method for quantifying RNA sequencing transcript abundance using pseudoalignment.
Kallisto performs rapid transcript quantification by using k-mer based pseudoalignment instead of traditional alignment algorithms.
The Kallisto module supports quantification against human (Gencode release 37) and mouse (Gencode release M26) transcriptomes.
Kallisto uses a k-mer length of 31 and generates transcript-level abundance estimates through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
The module can perform sequence-based bias correction to improve quantification accuracy of RNA-seq data.
Kallisto supports both single-end and paired-end RNA sequencing read quantification.
The module generates multiple output files including transcript abundance files, normalized gene-level abundance, and raw estimated counts.
Kallisto uses bootstrap sampling to estimate uncertainty in transcript abundance measurements, with a default of 2 bootstrap samples.
The module integrates Sleuth for gene-level aggregation and normalization of transcript abundance estimates.
Kallisto can generate pseudoalignment BAM files for visualization and further downstream analysis.
The module supports strand-specific RNA-seq library preparation protocols through read direction parameters.
Kallisto's pseudoalignment approach allows for faster computational processing compared to traditional alignment methods.
The module provides flexibility in specifying fragment length and standard deviation for more accurate quantification.
Kallisto can handle compressed FASTQ files directly, reducing preprocessing requirements.
The module includes options for setting random seed to ensure reproducibility of quantification results.
