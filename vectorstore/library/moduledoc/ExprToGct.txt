ExprToGct is on version .
A description of ExprToGct is Converts an EXPR file to GCT format. This module converts a file in EXPR format to GCT format. The EXPR file format is a tab-delimited format produced by the Cufflinks module. The ExprToGct module extracts expression data from an EXPR file and writes it to a GCT file..
ExprToGct is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Help (gp-help@broadinstitute.org).
ExprToGct can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
ExprToGct has the following parameters: input.file, output.prefix.
The ExprToGct GenePattern module is a data format conversion tool for transforming expression data files.
The ExprToGct module converts EXPR files, which contain RNA sequencing expression measurements, into the standardized GCT file format.
The module specifically translates Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) values from Cufflinks RNA-seq analysis into a universal expression matrix format.
ExprToGct enables researchers to convert transcript or gene expression data between different computational bioinformatics platforms and analysis environments.
The module preserves critical genomic metadata like chromosome names and genomic coordinates during the file format conversion process.
ExprToGct supports cross-platform compatibility by transforming expression data into the widely used GCT file format, which is standard in many genomic analysis tools.
The module allows researchers to standardize expression data from RNA sequencing experiments for downstream computational analysis and visualization.
By converting EXPR files to GCT, ExprToGct facilitates easier data sharing and integration across different bioinformatics research workflows and software platforms.
The module operates independently of specific computational platforms, running on any operating system and CPU architecture.
ExprToGct provides a simple, automated method for researchers to transform raw RNA sequencing expression measurements into a more universally readable format.
input.file | File | ExprToGct module requires an input file in EXPR format produced by Cufflinks | Required | No default value
output.prefix | String | ExprToGct module uses this label to name the output GCT file | Required | No default value
ExprToGct module converts expression data from EXPR format to GCT format
EXPR files contain Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) values
ExprToGct extracts transcript or gene ID information from input EXPR file
First column of EXPR file becomes Name column in output GCT file
Chromosome name and coordinate information are written to Description column of GCT file
FPKM values are written to data column of output GCT file
GCT format is a tab-delimited file used in GenePattern and other bioinformatics tools
Output file will be named <output.prefix>.gct
Module supports conversion between different genomic expression data formats
Conversion process preserves key information from original EXPR file
ExprToGct module input file (EXPR format):
A tab-delimited file produced by Cufflinks containing transcript or gene expression data
ExprToGct module input file contains columns for:
First column as unique identifier/name
FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments) values
Chromosome name
Left and right genomic coordinates
ExprToGct module output file (GCT format):
A tab-delimited file describing an expression dataset
ExprToGct GCT output file includes:
Row identifiers from first column of input EXPR file
Chromosome names in Description column
Left and right genomic coordinates in Description column
FPKM values in data column
ExprToGct module GCT file follows standard GenePattern expression matrix format
ExprToGct output filename follows pattern: <output.prefix>.gct
ExprToGct converts expression data between EXPR and GCT file formats
ExprToGct preserves key genomic and expression information during file conversion
ExprToGct supports cross-compatibility between different bioinformatics analysis tools
ExprToGct module converts expression data from EXPR format to GCT format for genomic analysis.
The ExprToGct module transforms Cufflinks-generated EXPR files into a standardized GenePattern file format.
EXPR files contain Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) for transcripts or genes.
The module extracts FPKM values and writes them into the data column of the resulting GCT file.
Chromosome names and genomic coordinates are transferred to the Description column in the GCT output.
The first column of the EXPR file becomes the Name column (row identifiers) in the generated GCT file.
GCT format is a tab-delimited file format widely used in genomic expression data analysis tools.
The ExprToGct module supports cross-platform data conversion, working on any CPU and operating system.
The output file is named using the specified output prefix with a .gct file extension.
This module enables researchers to standardize expression data from Cufflinks for further computational analysis.
The conversion process preserves key genomic and expression information during file format transformation.
