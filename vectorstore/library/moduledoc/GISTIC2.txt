GISTIC2 is on version 2.0.23.
A description of GISTIC2 is Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer, version 2.0. The GISTIC module identifies regions of the genome that are significantly amplified or deleted across a set of samples. Each aberration is assigned a G-score that considers the amplitude of the aberration as well as the frequency of its occurrence across samples..

GISTIC2 is a computational method for identifying significant regions of genomic copy number alterations in cancer samples.
GISTIC2 calculates a G-score for each genomic region that considers both the amplitude and frequency of copy number changes across multiple samples.
The module assigns statistical significance to genomic regions using false discovery rate (FDR) q-values, with regions below a user-defined threshold considered significant.
GISTIC2 identifies "peak regions" within aberrant genomic segments that have the highest amplitude and frequency of alteration.
The method uses a leave-one-out algorithm to determine robust "wide peak" boundaries that are less sensitive to individual sample variations.
GISTIC2 can distinguish between broad chromosomal-level events and focal genetic alterations in cancer genomes.
The module generates multiple output files, including a comprehensive summary of significant amplifications and deletions across samples.
GISTIC2 requires input files including segmented copy number data, a reference genome file, and optionally a markers file.
The analysis can be customized through multiple parameters like amplification/deletion thresholds, significance cutoffs, and analysis resolution.
GISTIC2 provides gene-level insights by identifying genes located within significant copy number alteration regions.
The module can perform both focal and broad-level analyses of genomic copy number changes.
GISTIC2 generates visualization outputs like heatmaps and score plots to help researchers interpret genomic alteration patterns.
The method was developed to provide sensitive and confident localization of somatic copy number alterations across cancer samples.
