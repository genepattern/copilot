ExtractFCSKeywords is on version 2.
A description of ExtractFCSKeywords is Extracts keyword(s) value(s) from a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file. This module can be used to extract and save the information in all keyword/value pair(s) so that it can be added back later. The keywords value pairs can either be stored as a CSV file (default) or as an FCS text segment chunk in a text file..
ExtractFCSKeywords is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca).
ExtractFCSKeywords can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
ExtractFCSKeywords has the following parameters: Input FCS data file, Keywords output mode, Keywords output file name.
The ExtractFCSKeywords module is a specialized tool for extracting metadata from Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files.
ExtractFCSKeywords allows researchers to preserve critical metadata that might be lost during file format conversions.
The module can extract keyword/value pairs that contain important experimental information like date of acquisition, instrument details, and sample characteristics.
ExtractFCSKeywords supports two output formats: a CSV file with keyword and value columns, or a text file maintaining the original FCS text segment format.
This GenePattern module is particularly useful in flow cytometry research for maintaining the contextual information associated with cellular measurement data.
ExtractFCSKeywords can help researchers track experimental details that are crucial for reproducibility and comprehensive data interpretation.
The module is designed to work with FCS 3.1 file standards, ensuring compatibility with modern flow cytometry data formats.
ExtractFCSKeywords requires Java 1.6 or higher and can run on any operating system, making it widely accessible to researchers.
The module can process large FCS files with up to 1,000,000 events, with an estimated maximum memory usage of 1.2 GB.
ExtractFCSKeywords is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry module suite, designed to support advanced cytometric data analysis workflows.

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the ExtractFCSKeywords module:
Input FCS file is a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file containing metadata keywords and flow cytometry measurement data.
Input FCS file contains keyword/value pairs in the TEXT segment with information about data acquisition, instrument settings, sample details, and experimental metadata.
Input FCS file follows the FCS 3.1 file standard with structured metadata and event measurement data.
Output CSV file contains two columns with extracted keyword names and their corresponding values from the input FCS file.
Output CSV file provides a tabular representation of all metadata keywords present in the original FCS file.
Output text file contains the raw FCS TEXT segment chunk with original keyword formatting when selected in output mode.
Output text file preserves the exact keyword/value pair structure from the input FCS file's TEXT segment.
Output file extension will be .csv or .txt depending on the selected keywords output mode.
Output file name defaults to the input FCS filename if not explicitly specified by the user.
ExtractFCSKeywords is a module designed to extract metadata from Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files.
The ExtractFCSKeywords module helps preserve critical metadata that can be lost during file format conversions.
Flow cytometry data files contain important metadata stored as keyword/value pairs in the TEXT segment of the file.
Metadata in FCS files can include information about data acquisition, cell descriptions, instrument settings, and sample characteristics.
The module allows extraction of keyword/value pairs in two output formats: CSV or FCS text segment chunk.
ExtractFCSKeywords supports processing large FCS files with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters.
The module requires Java 1.6 or higher and can run on any CPU and operating system.
Users can specify which keywords they want to extract from the input FCS file.
The default output is a CSV file with two columns: one for keywords and one for their corresponding values.
ExtractFCSKeywords helps researchers preserve and transfer important experimental metadata across different file formats.
The module is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry analysis toolkit.
Extracted metadata can include details like acquisition date, instrument type, operator name, and sample identification.
The module supports the FCS 3.1 file standard, ensuring compatibility with modern flow cytometry data formats.
