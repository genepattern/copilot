Picard.ReorderSam is on version .
A description of Picard.ReorderSam is Reorders reads in a SAM/BAM file to match the contig ordering in a provided reference file. Reads mapped to contigs absent in the new reference are dropped..
Picard.ReorderSam is a GenePattern module written by Picard team, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
Picard.ReorderSam can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
Picard.ReorderSam has the following parameters: input.file, reference.file, reference.sequence.dictionary, allow.partial.overlap, allow.contig.length.discordance, output.prefix.
The Picard.ReorderSam module is a critical bioinformatics tool for reorganizing genomic alignment files to match a specific reference sequence.
Picard.ReorderSam helps researchers align sequencing reads to a standardized contig order, ensuring consistent genomic representation across different datasets.
The Picard.ReorderSam module allows researchers to precisely match read alignments to a specific reference genome, dropping reads that do not correspond to known contigs.
Picard.ReorderSam is particularly useful when working with genomic data from different sources or when transitioning between reference genome versions.
The module operates by comparing contig names between the input SAM/BAM file and a provided reference FASTA file, reordering reads accordingly.
Picard.ReorderSam can optionally allow partial overlap between input and reference contigs, providing flexibility in genomic alignment workflows.
Researchers using Picard.ReorderSam must be cautious about potential data loss, as reads mapped to unrecognized contigs will be dropped during the reordering process.
The module performs most efficiently with indexed BAM files, which can significantly speed up the computational processing of large genomic datasets.
Picard.ReorderSam is a Java-based tool compatible with multiple computing platforms, making it widely accessible for genomic research.
The module requires precise specification of input files, reference sequences, and sequence dictionaries to ensure accurate read reordering.
Picard.ReorderSam is particularly valuable in comparative genomics, helping standardize read alignments across different research projects and datasets.
input.file | File | Picard ReorderSam module requires an input BAM or SAM file for read reordering | Required | No default
reference.file | File | FASTA reference sequence file used to determine new contig ordering in Picard ReorderSam | Required | No default
reference.sequence.dictionary | File | Sequence dictionary corresponding to the reference sequence file in Picard ReorderSam | Required | No default
allow.partial.overlap | Boolean | In Picard ReorderSam, determines whether partial overlap between BAM contigs and new reference sequence contigs is permitted | Required | Default: no
allow.contig.length.discordance | Boolean | In Picard ReorderSam, controls whether mapping is allowed between contigs with same name but different lengths | Required | Default: no
output.prefix | String | Prefix for the output SAM or BAM file generated by Picard ReorderSam module | Required | No default
Picard.ReorderSam input file is a BAM or SAM alignment file containing genomic sequencing reads.
Picard.ReorderSam reference file is a FASTA format file containing reference genome sequence contigs.
Picard.ReorderSam reference sequence dictionary is a file specifying the contig names and lengths for the reference genome.
Picard.ReorderSam input alignment file must contain mapped reads with contig names matching the reference file.
Picard.ReorderSam output file is a reordered BAM or SAM file with reads aligned to match the new reference contig order.
Picard.ReorderSam input BAM files are most efficiently processed when they are indexed.
Picard.ReorderSam can optionally allow partial contig overlap or contig length discordance between input and reference files.
Picard.ReorderSam reads mapped to contigs not present in the new reference will be dropped from the output file.
Picard.ReorderSam requires exact contig name matching between input alignment and reference sequence files.
Picard.ReorderSam output file preserves the original alignment information while reordering reads to match reference contigs.
Picard.ReorderSam is a computational genomics module designed to reorganize read alignments in SAM/BAM files.
The Picard.ReorderSam module allows researchers to reorder genomic sequence reads to match a specific reference file's contig arrangement.
Picard.ReorderSam requires three key input files: a BAM/SAM input file, a reference FASTA file, and a sequence dictionary for the reference.
The module can optionally allow partial overlap between input read contigs and reference contigs through a configurable parameter.
Picard.ReorderSam provides researchers a way to standardize read alignment ordering across different genomic reference sequences.
Reads mapped to contigs not present in the new reference will be automatically dropped during the reordering process.
The module performs faster when processing an indexed BAM file, making it computationally efficient for large genomic datasets.
Picard.ReorderSam is implemented in Java and requires a minimum Java version of 1.6 to execute.
The module can generate output in either SAM or BAM format, matching the input file's original format.
Researchers should use the contig length discordance option with extreme caution, as it can introduce potential mapping inconsistencies.
