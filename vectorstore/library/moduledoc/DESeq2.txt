DESeq2 is on version 1.0.
A description of DESeq2 is A Differential Expression workflow for RNA-Seq data for the GenePattern platform, based on the DESeq2 package from Bioconductor.
DESeq2 is a GenePattern module written by David Eby;Broad Institute.
DESeq2 can be categorized as RNA-Seq, Differential Expression, Bioinformatics.
DESeq2 has the following parameters: input file, cls file, confounding variable cls file, output file base, qc plot format, fdr threshold, top N count, random seed.
The DESeq2 GenePattern module is a powerful tool for analyzing differential gene expression in RNA-Seq data.
DESeq2 helps researchers identify genes that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated between different experimental conditions.
The module specifically works with raw RNA-Seq count data, not normalized expression values like RPKM or FPKM.
DESeq2 requires two primary input files: a GCT file containing raw RNA-Seq counts and a CLS file specifying sample phenotypes or experimental conditions.
The module uses a negative binomial distribution to model gene expression data, which helps account for the variability inherent in RNA-Seq experiments.
DESeq2 calculates log2 fold change to quantify the magnitude of gene expression differences between experimental groups.
The module generates multiple output files, including a results report, mean values by class, and lists of top up-regulated and down-regulated genes.
DESeq2 performs statistical filtering using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control for false discovery rate (FDR) in differential expression analysis.
The module can optionally include a confounding variable CLS file to control for additional experimental factors.
DESeq2 produces visualization outputs like MA plots and dispersion estimates to help researchers understand the gene expression patterns.
The GenePattern implementation of DESeq2 is based on the Bioconductor DESeq2 package, making it accessible through a user-friendly interface.
Researchers can customize the analysis by setting parameters like FDR threshold and the number of top genes to report.
The module pre-filters data by removing genes with very low or zero expression across all samples to improve computational efficiency.
DESeq2 is particularly useful in fields like cancer research, developmental biology, and comparative genomics for identifying key gene expression changes.
input file (file, required): Raw RNA-Seq counts in GCT format, generated by tools like HTSeq-Count, containing un-normalized read counts for genomic features.
cls file (file, required): Categorical CLS file specifying phenotype classes for samples, must contain exactly two classes with control specified first.
confounding variable cls file (file, optional): Additional categorical CLS file re-categorizing samples according to a secondary class for more complex analysis.
output file base (string, required): Base name for output files, to which file extensions will be automatically added.
qc plot format (string, required): Specifies file format for quality control plots, or option to skip plot generation.
fdr threshold (numeric, required): False Discovery Rate threshold used for filtering genes before generating reports of up/down-regulated genes.
top N count (integer, required): Maximum number of genes to include when creating reports of top up-regulated and down-regulated genes.
random seed (integer, optional): Seed value used for randomization processes in the statistical analysis, helps ensure reproducibility of results.
Here are the input and output files for the DESeq2 module, formatted in atomic, semantically distinct chunks:
DESeq2 module requires a GCT file containing raw RNA-Seq read counts from HTSeq-Count.
DESeq2 input file must contain un-normalized read count data, not RPKM or FPKM values.
DESeq2 requires a CLS file categorizing samples by phenotype, treatment, or cell type.
DESeq2 optionally accepts a second CLS file for confounding variables.
DESeq2 generates a results report file with gene-level differential expression statistics.
DESeq2 output includes a results report ordered by adjusted p-value (padj).
DESeq2 creates a mean values file showing per-row mean values for each class.
DESeq2 generates top N up-regulated and down-regulated gene reports.
DESeq2 produces normalized count files in both TXT and GCT formats.
DESeq2 optionally creates visualization plots like MA plot and dispersion estimates plot.
DESeq2 results file contains columns for gene ID, base mean, log2 fold change, standard error, statistical test results, and p-values.
DESeq2 filters out features with total read count of 0 or 1 before analysis.
