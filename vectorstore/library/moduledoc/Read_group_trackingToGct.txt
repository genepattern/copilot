Read_group_trackingToGct is on version v1.
A description of Read_group_trackingToGct is Converts a Cufflinks read_group_tracking file into GenePattern's GCT format for use in downstream modules. The module extracts quantification values (such as FPKM) from Cuffdiff read_group_tracking files and can optionally map tracking IDs to gene symbols..
Read_group_trackingToGct is a GenePattern module written by David Eby, Broad Institute.
Read_group_trackingToGct can be categorized as RNA-seq, Data Format Conversion, Preprocess & Utilities.
Read_group_trackingToGct has the following parameters: input file, output file name, expression value column, screen out errors, output value for errors, gtf file, feature level for symbol lookup, choose gct column for mapping, report naming conflict details, override attribute name for lookup, override attribute name for retrieval.
The Read_group_trackingToGct module converts Cufflinks read_group_tracking files into GenePattern's GCT format for downstream bioinformatics analysis.
The Read_group_trackingToGct module enables conversion of RNA-seq quantification data from Cufflinks tracking files to a standardized GCT format.
This module allows researchers to extract different types of expression quantification values, including raw fragments, scaled fragments, and FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads).
The Read_group_trackingToGct module can optionally map tracking IDs to gene symbols using a provided GTF file, improving the interpretability of the output data.
By default, the module screens out expression values with non-OK quantification status, ensuring data quality for downstream analysis.
The Read_group_trackingToGct module generates not just a GCT file, but also a companion CLS file and a summary report detailing quantification status.
This module is particularly useful for preparing RNA-seq data for further analysis in GenePattern modules like ConsensusClustering and NMFConsensus.
The Read_group_trackingToGct module provides flexibility in handling different feature levels, including genes, isoforms, transcription start sites, and coding sequences.
Researchers can customize the mapping process by specifying different attribute names for lookup and retrieval in the GTF file using the Read_group_trackingToGct module.
The module helps address complexities in RNA-seq data quantification, such as handling tracking IDs that may not directly map to gene symbols.
