Cutoff zscore parameter sets the z-score threshold for mean values across leaf branches.
Cutoff pvalue parameter establishes the p-value threshold for statistical tests like Kruskal-Wallis H-test.
Num genes parameter controls the number of genes to be plotted in output visualizations.
Figure height parameter sets the vertical size of matplotlib graphs, with a default of 8.
Figure width parameter determines the horizontal size of matplotlib plots, with a default of 8.
STREAM.DetectTransitionGenes module helps identify marker genes across different branches of single-cell trajectories.
The module uses Spearman's rank correlation to detect genes with significant expression changes between branch points.
