GEOImporter is on version 6.
A description of GEOImporter is Creates a gct file from a GEO series record or a GEO Dataset. For more information about GEO, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. The GCT file format is described at https://www.genepattern.org/file-formats-guide#GCT..
GEOImporter is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, Anthony Castanza, Barbara A Hill.
GEOImporter can be categorized as Data Import.
GEOImporter has the following parameters: GEO.accession, GEO.SOFT.filename, Drop.NA.Rows, data.column.name, output.file.
The GEOImporter module allows researchers to directly import gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository into GenePattern.
The GEOImporter module enables conversion of GEO datasets into the standardized GCT file format for further bioinformatics analysis.
Researchers can import data using either a GEO Series accession number (GSExxx) or a GEO Dataset accession number (GDSxxx).
The GEOImporter module supports importing data through either a direct GEO accession number or by uploading a GEO SOFT file containing the dataset information.
Users of the GEOImporter can choose to drop rows containing only "NA" values, which helps clean and prepare datasets for downstream analysis.
The GEOImporter module is particularly useful for researchers who want to quickly transfer publicly available gene expression datasets into analysis-ready formats.
By converting GEO data to GCT files, the GEOImporter facilitates seamless integration with other GenePattern modules and bioinformatics workflows.
The module runs on R 4.0.3 and is packaged in a specific Docker container, ensuring consistent and reproducible data import processes.
Researchers in fields like cancer genomics, developmental biology, and systems biology can leverage the GEOImporter to access and standardize large-scale gene expression datasets.
The GEOImporter supports flexible data column selection, allowing users to specify which column contains the relevant expression values during import.
GEO.accession: String, specifies the GEO Series record (GSExxx) or GEO Dataset (GDSxxx) to import, required if no SOFT file is provided.
GEO.SOFT.filename: String, path to the GEO SOFT file, required if no GEO accession is provided.
Drop.NA.Rows: Boolean, determines whether rows containing all "NA" values should be omitted from GSExxx series GEO datasets, default is FALSE.
data.column.name: String, specifies the column name containing expression values when input is a GEO series, required for proper data extraction.
output.file: String, defines the name of the output GCT file that will be generated by the GEOImporter module, required for saving results.
GEOImporter module input and output file descriptions:
GEO accession is a text identifier for a Gene Expression Omnibus series or dataset record.
GEO SOFT file is a tab-delimited text file containing gene expression metadata and experimental details from NCBI GEO.
Input GEO accession or SOFT file can be retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.
Drop.NA.Rows parameter allows filtering of rows with all missing values in GSE series datasets.
Data column name specifies which column contains expression measurements in the input file.
Output file is a GCT (Gene Cluster Transformation) format file containing gene expression data.
GCT output file contains a matrix of gene expression values with gene identifiers and sample names.
GCT file has a specific header format with version, number of rows and columns, and tab-delimited data.
GCT file includes gene names, descriptions, and expression measurements across multiple samples.
GEOImporter module transforms raw GEO data into a standardized gene expression matrix format.
The GEOImporter module allows researchers to import gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository into a standardized GCT file format.
The GEOImporter module enables downloading and converting gene expression datasets from GEO using either a GEO Series accession number or a SOFT file.
Users can specify a GEO accession (GSExxx or GDSxxx) or provide a direct SOFT file as input to the GEOImporter module.
The module supports optional filtering of rows containing only "NA" values, allowing researchers to clean their datasets during import.
Users can specify a custom data column name when importing from a GEO series, providing flexibility in data extraction.
The GEOImporter module generates a standard GCT file, which is a tab-delimited format commonly used in gene expression analysis.
The module is implemented in R version 4.0.3 and packaged in a specific Docker container for consistent computational environments.
Version 6 of the GEOImporter added support for omitting rows with all "NA" values and updated to use a dedicated Docker container.
The module is maintained on GitHub and provides a standardized method for researchers to import and process gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
