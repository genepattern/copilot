FastQC is on version 1.
A description of FastQC is Generates a QC report on raw sequence data. FastQC takes as input the raw sequencing data (short read data contained within a FastQ, BAM or SAM file) produced by an NGS sequencing platform and produces a quality control report which can identify problems that might have originated either in the sequencer or during library preparation..
FastQC is a GenePattern module written by Brabaham Institute.
FastQC can be categorized as RNA-seq, Quality Control.
FastQC has the following parameters: input file, input format, contaminant file, kmer size, extract output.
