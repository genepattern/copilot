MutSigCV is on version 1.3.01.
A description of MutSigCV is Identifies genes that are significantly mutated in cancer genomes, using a model with mutational covariates. MutSigCV accepts whole genome or whole exome sequencing data from multiple samples, with information about point mutations, small insertions/deletions, and coverage, and identifies genes that are mutated more often than one would expect by chance..
MutSigCV is a GenePattern module written by Mike Lawrence, et al., Broad Institute.
MutSigCV can be categorized as Cancer Genomics, Mutation Analysis, Bioinformatics.
MutSigCV has the following parameters: mutation table file, coverage table file, covariates table file, output filename base, mutation type dictionary, genome build.
The MutSigCV GenePattern module is a computational tool for identifying significantly mutated genes in cancer genomic data.
MutSigCV helps researchers distinguish between random mutations and potentially cancer-driving genetic alterations in large-scale sequencing datasets.
The module uses advanced statistical modeling to account for variations in mutation rates across different genes and patients, reducing false positive results.
MutSigCV incorporates multiple genomic covariates like gene expression levels, DNA replication timing, and chromatin state to improve mutation significance analysis.
The tool requires three key input files: a mutation annotation file (MAF), a coverage file, and a covariates file to perform its comprehensive genetic analysis.
MutSigCV was developed specifically for analyzing somatic mutations in cancer genomes, though it has been used with germline mutations in some studies.
The module is particularly useful for researchers working with whole genome or whole exome sequencing data from multiple cancer samples.
MutSigCV helps address the challenge of distinguishing driver mutations from background mutations as sample sizes in cancer genomics studies increase.
The tool pools mutations into specific categories that consider both sequence context and functional impact, providing a nuanced approach to mutation analysis.
MutSigCV generates an output file listing significantly mutated genes, ranked by their statistical significance in the cancer dataset.
The module is most effective for cancers with higher mutation rates and may not produce reliable results for low-mutation cancers like some pediatric malignancies.
MutSigCV represents an advanced computational approach to identifying potential cancer-related genetic alterations by accounting for complex genomic variability.
mutation table file: File type is MAF (Mutation Annotation Format), required input containing list of mutations detected in sequencing project, specifies gene, patient, mutation effect, and category.
coverage table file: Tab-delimited file, required input detailing sequencing coverage achieved for each gene and patient, broken down by mutation category and effect.
covariates table file: Required tab-delimited text file containing genomic covariate data for each gene, including expression levels, DNA replication times, and chromatin state.
output filename base: Required parameter specifying base name for output files generated by MutSigCV analysis.
mutation type dictionary: Optional parameter used for automatic mutation category and effect discovery when MAF file lacks specific columns, necessary only for incomplete MAF files.
genome build: Optional parameter specifying genome build for automatic mutation category and effect discovery, required only when using MAF files without specific columns, currently supports hg19 and hg18.
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the MutSigCV module:
MAF mutation file is a tab-delimited text file listing somatic mutations with gene, patient, effect, and category columns.
Coverage file is a tab-delimited file detailing the number of bases covered for each gene, patient, mutation category, and effect type.
Covariates file is a tab-delimited text file containing genomic covariate data like gene expression levels, DNA replication times, and chromatin state.
Output file is a tab-delimited report listing significant mutations in descending order of significance.
The MAF file contains columns for gene name, patient identifier, mutation effect, and mutation category.
The coverage file tracks sequencing depth across genes, patients, mutation categories, and effect types.
The covariates file includes gene-level data on expression, replication timing, and chromatin accessibility.
The output file provides statistical details about significantly mutated genes in the analyzed cancer genome dataset.
MutSigCV requires precise matching of gene and sample names across input files.
The MAF file can be generated by tools like MuTect and Oncotator for cancer genome mutation analysis.
Coverage information can be derived from WIG format files or a provided full coverage reference file.
The covariates file helps normalize mutation rates across different genomic contexts.
Here are the chunks for the MutSigCV module documentation:
MutSigCV is a computational method for identifying significantly mutated genes in cancer genomes.
The module analyzes whole genome or whole exome sequencing data from multiple cancer samples to detect genes mutated more frequently than expected by chance.
MutSigCV addresses the challenge of false positive detection in cancer gene identification by incorporating patient-specific and gene-specific mutation rate variations.
The algorithm corrects for factors like gene expression levels, DNA replication timing, and chromatin state that influence mutation frequencies.
MutSigCV uses a sophisticated background mutation model that considers patient-based and genomic position-based factors in mutation probability.
The module requires three input files: a mutation annotation file (MAF), a coverage file, and a covariates file to perform its analysis.
Mutation categories in MutSigCV are pooled to consider sequence context and functional impact, including transitions, transversions, and indel mutations.
The algorithm generates a significance score for each gene, controlling for false discovery rate to identify potentially important cancer driver genes.
MutSigCV was developed by researchers at the Broad Institute to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer gene detection across large genomic datasets.
The module is most effective for cancers with moderate to high mutation rates and may not produce reliable results for low-mutation cancers like pediatric tumors.
