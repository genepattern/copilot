AddFCSParameter is on version 2.
A description of AddFCSParameter is Adds parameters and their values to a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data file. This module inserts a calculated value for each event directly into an FCS file..
AddFCSParameter is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
AddFCSParameter can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
AddFCSParameter has the following parameters: Input fcs data file, Input csv file, Output file name.
The AddFCSParameter module allows researchers to add calculated parameters directly to Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.
AddFCSParameter enables biologists to insert new computational measurements into existing flow cytometry datasets without modifying the original raw data.
The module supports adding multiple new parameters simultaneously through a comma-separated values (CSV) file with precise event-level mapping requirements.
AddFCSParameter requires that the CSV file have exactly the same number of rows as events in the original FCS file, ensuring complete parameter coverage.
Users can specify both short and long names for new flow cytometry parameters using a colon-separated naming convention in the CSV header.
The AddFCSParameter module is particularly useful for researchers who need to integrate derived computational measurements directly into their flow cytometry analysis workflow.
AddFCSParameter operates across multiple computing platforms, being implemented in Java and compatible with various operating systems and hardware configurations.
The module maintains the original FCS file structure while allowing flexible insertion of calculated parameters for downstream analysis and visualization.
AddFCSParameter supports large-scale flow cytometry datasets, with tested performance on files containing up to 1,000,000 events and multiple new parameters.
Researchers can use AddFCSParameter to standardize parameter naming and integrate complex computational measurements into their flow cytometry data files.
The module follows international cytometry data standards, ensuring compatibility with broader scientific data exchange protocols.
AddFCSParameter provides a flexible solution for researchers who need to augment flow cytometry datasets with computed parameters without manual data manipulation.
Input fcs data file | File | Specifies the input Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file to which parameters will be added | Required | No default
Input csv file | File | Contains additional parameter values to be inserted into the FCS file | Required | No default
Output file name | String | Defines the name of the output FCS file | Optional | Uses input file name as base
AddFCSParameter module requires a CSV file with parameter values matching the number of events in the input FCS file
AddFCSParameter module supports adding multiple parameters in a single CSV file
CSV file first row must contain parameter names, which can include short and long names separated by a colon
Each column in the CSV file represents a new parameter to be added to the FCS file
AddFCSParameter module ensures every event in the FCS file has a corresponding value in the CSV file
AddFCSParameter module is compatible with FCS 3.0 file format and floating point data type
AddFCSParameter module supports adding calculated values directly to FCS files for tools that only read FCS files
AddFCSParameter module recommends keeping original FCS files unmodified and storing calculated values externally
AddFCSParameter module input and output file descriptions:
Input FCS data file is a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file containing cytometry event data with existing parameters.
Input CSV file contains calculated parameter values to be added to the FCS file, with parameter names in the first row and one value per event in subsequent rows.
Output FCS data file is an updated FCS file with the original events and parameters plus newly added parameters from the CSV file.
The input CSV file must have exactly one row for parameter names and one row per event matching the total number of events in the input FCS file.
The input CSV file can specify both short and long parameter names using a colon separator in the header row.
The input CSV file supports adding multiple parameters simultaneously by including multiple columns.
The output FCS file preserves all original FCS file characteristics while incorporating the new calculated parameters.
The input FCS file can contain up to 24 parameters and 1,000,000 events based on module performance estimates.
The output FCS file will be in the same format as the input file, typically FCS 3.0 with floating point data type.
AddFCSParameter is a GenePattern module for adding calculated parameters to Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.
The module allows insertion of new parameter values into an existing FCS file using a CSV file as the source of calculated values.
Each new parameter must have a calculated value for every single event in the original FCS file.
The CSV file can specify both short and long names for parameters using a colon separator, like "FL1-H:CD4".
Multiple parameters can be added simultaneously by including multiple columns in the CSV file.
The module is designed to be compatible with tools that only read FCS files directly, though keeping calculated values in external files is recommended.
The module supports adding parameters to FCS files with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters.
AddFCSParameter requires Java 1.5 or higher and can run on any CPU or operating system.
The module was developed by Josef Spidlen and is part of the flow cytometry module suite in GenePattern.
The output is a new FCS file containing all original events and parameters, plus the newly calculated parameters.
The CSV file must have a header row specifying parameter names, followed by one row per event with calculated values.
