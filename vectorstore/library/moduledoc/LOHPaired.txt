LOHPaired is on version .
A description of LOHPaired is Detects Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). It takes as input a GenePattern .snp file that contains paired normal-target samples with genotype calls and returns a GenePattern .loh file containing LOH calls for each probe and array pair..
LOHPaired is a GenePattern module written by Jim Robinson, David Twomey, Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
LOHPaired can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
LOHPaired has the following parameters: input filename, sample info filename, output file.
The LOHPaired module is a computational tool for detecting Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) in paired normal and tumor samples.
LOHPaired helps researchers identify genetic changes where a previously heterozygous region becomes homozygous in a tumor sample.
The module specifically analyzes genetic variations by comparing genotype calls between normal and tumor tissue samples.
LOHPaired works with non-allele-specific SNP files, processing genetic information from Affymetrix SNP chip data.
The module classifies genetic changes into specific categories: LOH (L), Retention (R), Conflict (C), and Non-informative calls (N).
LOHPaired is particularly useful in cancer research for understanding genetic alterations that might contribute to tumor development.
The module requires a sample information file that defines normal-tumor sample pairs for comparative analysis.
LOHPaired generates an output .loh file that provides detailed genetic call information for each probe in the sample pairs.
The module's classification system allows researchers to systematically track genetic changes across different genomic regions.
LOHPaired is part of the GenePattern suite, making it accessible to researchers with varying computational backgrounds.
The tool is based on computational methods developed by researchers like Ming Lin and colleagues in genomic analysis.
LOHPaired can help identify potential genetic mechanisms underlying cancer progression and tumor development.
The module supports cross-platform analysis, running on various operating systems and computer architectures.
LOHPaired provides a standardized approach to detecting Loss of Heterozygosity across different genetic samples.
The module is particularly valuable in translational research connecting genetic variations to potential disease mechanisms.

The LOHPaired module detects loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in paired normal-tumor genetic samples.
LOHPaired analyzes genetic variation by comparing genotype calls between normal and tumor tissue samples.
The module requires a GenePattern .snp file containing paired normal and target sample genotype information.
LOHPaired specifically works with non-allele-specific SNP files that have one intensity value per genetic probe.
The module classifies genetic probe states into five distinct categories: LOH, Retention, Conflict, Non-informative, and No Call.
LOH detection depends on comparing genotype calls between normal and tumor samples across different genetic probe states.
The module uses a matrix-based approach to determine genetic alterations by examining allelic configurations in normal and tumor samples.
LOHPaired generates an output .loh file that contains LOH calls for each probe in each array pair.
The underlying algorithm is based on computational methods developed by researchers like Ming Lin and colleagues in SNP array analysis.
