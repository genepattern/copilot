CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport is on version 1.
A description of CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport is CummeRbund is a visualization package designed to help navigate through Cuffdiff RNA-Seq differential expression analysis results. This specific module provides plots based on a single user-specified gene, allowing visualization and creation of publication-ready figures of RNA-Seq data..
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport is a GenePattern module written by Loyal Goff, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can be categorized as RNA-seq, Bioinformatics, Visualization.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport has the following parameters: cuffdiff input, feature id, selected.conditions, find.similar, output format, feature level, report as aggregate, log transform.
The CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport module is a specialized RNA-Seq data visualization tool in the GenePattern bioinformatics platform.
The CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport allows researchers to generate detailed visualizations for a single user-specified gene from Cuffdiff RNA-Seq differential expression analysis results.
This module can produce multiple types of expression plots, including bar plots and line plots showing gene expression levels across different experimental conditions.
The CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can generate plots at different feature levels, including genes, isoforms, transcript start sites, and coding sequences.
Researchers can use the CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport to compare expression levels of a specific gene across multiple experimental conditions or replicates.
The module provides an option to find and plot genes with expression profiles most similar to the selected gene of interest.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can log transform FPKM values, allowing for different visualization and comparison of gene expression data.
The module is part of a collaborative effort between MIT's Computational Biology group and Harvard University's Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine department.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport requires the entire Cuffdiff job output or a pre-generated database file for processing RNA-Seq data.
The module generates multiple output files, including expression bar plots, expression line plots, and similarity expression plots for the selected gene.
cuffdiff.input (File): Required input for CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport module, which can be a Cuffdiff job folder, previous CummeRbund job, or cuffData.db file.
feature.id (String): Required parameter specifying the specific gene or feature to analyze, which can be a gene symbol, gene ID, isoform ID, TSS group ID, or CDS ID.
selected.conditions (String): Optional parameter to specify which conditions/samples to include in plots, using comma-separated condition names from the original Cuffdiff job.
find.similar (Integer): Optional parameter to identify and plot genes with expression profiles most similar to the selected gene, up to the specified count.
output.format (String): Required parameter to specify the output file format for generated plots and reports.
feature.level (String): Required parameter to determine the level of analysis, such as genes, isoforms, transcript start sites, or coding sequences.
report.as.aggregate (Boolean): Optional parameter controlling whether reporting uses individual replicates or aggregate condition/sample values, with default set to aggregate samples.
log.transform (Boolean): Optional parameter to determine whether FPKM values should be log-transformed for visualization, affecting the y-axis scale.
Here are the input and output files for the CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport module:
Input Files:
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport requires a Cuffdiff job folder containing differential expression analysis output files
The input can be a complete Cuffdiff job folder, a previous CummeRbund job folder, or a pre-generated cuffData.db database file
Input files must include all Cuffdiff output files to enable comprehensive RNA-seq data visualization
The input files contain raw RNA-seq differential expression data from multiple experimental conditions
Input files include gene expression measurements, statistical tests, and fold change information
Output Files:
cuffData.db is an RSQLite database created from the original Cuffdiff job for rapid data access
SelectedGene.ExpressionBarplot shows FPKM values with confidence intervals for the selected gene across samples
SelectedGene.ExpressionPlot displays FPKM values as a line plot with confidence intervals for the selected gene
SelectedGene.SimilarityExpressionBarplot presents FPKM values for genes with similar expression profiles
SelectedGene.SimilarityExpressionPlot shows line plot of genes with expression profiles similar to the selected gene
stdout.txt and stderr.txt provide logs of the database creation and plotting process, including any errors encountered
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport is a GenePattern module for visualizing RNA-Seq differential expression data from Cuffdiff analysis.
The module allows researchers to generate detailed visualizations focused on a single user-specified gene.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can produce expression plots, bar charts, and similarity comparisons across different experimental conditions.
The module requires the entire Cuffdiff job output folder as input, not just individual files.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can generate visualizations at different feature levels including genes, isoforms, transcript start sites, and coding sequences.
Users can specify specific conditions to include in the analysis and control whether data is reported at the replicate or aggregate sample level.
The module creates an RSQLite database from Cuffdiff results to enable rapid data access and visualization.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport can optionally find and plot genes with expression profiles most similar to the selected gene of interest.
The module supports log transformation of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values for visualization.
CummeRbund.SelectedGeneReport was developed through a collaborative effort between computational biology groups at MIT and Harvard.
The module requires R version 2.15.3 and automatically checks for and installs necessary supporting R packages.
