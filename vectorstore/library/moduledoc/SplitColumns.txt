SplitColumns is on version 1.
A description of SplitColumns is Splits columns in a file containing a data matrix into a separate file. This module will either use the Unix cut command if available or Perl..
SplitColumns is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Dane Nazaire, gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
SplitColumns can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
SplitColumns has the following parameters: input file, split columns, additional columns, output prefix.
The SplitColumns GenePattern module allows researchers to extract specific columns from a tab-delimited data matrix file.
The SplitColumns module can separate individual columns from complex multi-column datasets for further analysis.
Researchers can use SplitColumns to isolate specific data columns of interest, such as gene expression values or experimental measurements.
The SplitColumns module supports flexible column selection, including individual columns, ranges of columns, and open-ended ranges like "4-" to select all columns from column 4 onward.
SplitColumns generates separate output files for each selected column, with filenames including the output prefix and column number.
The module works across multiple platforms including Mac and Linux operating systems, making it versatile for different computational environments.
SplitColumns can be particularly useful in genomics and transcriptomics research for parsing large datasets into more manageable subsets.
Bioinformaticians can use the SplitColumns module as a preprocessing step to prepare data for downstream analysis like statistical modeling or visualization.
The module provides flexibility by allowing researchers to include additional columns in each output file beyond the primary column of interest.
SplitColumns leverages either Unix cut commands or Perl scripting, ensuring broad compatibility and reliable performance across different computational systems.

SplitColumns module requires an input data matrix file with tab-delimited format containing multiple columns of data.
The input file for the SplitColumns module is a tab-delimited text file containing a multi-column data matrix.
The input file can contain any type of numerical or categorical data arranged in columns.
The SplitColumns module generates output files with a naming convention of <output.prefix>_<column_number>.splitcol.txt.
Each output file contains data from a specific column of the original input file, potentially including additional specified columns.
The output files preserve the original data format and structure, just with reduced column count.
Users can specify which columns to extract using the "split columns" parameter, with flexible range selection options.
The module supports extracting single columns, multiple discrete columns, or column ranges from the input data matrix.
Additional columns can be included in each output file through the "additional columns" parameter.
The output files are text files with tab-delimited format, matching the input file's original structure.
The SplitColumns module works on Mac and Linux platforms using Unix or Perl processing.
SplitColumns module is a data preprocessing tool for splitting columns from a tab-delimited data matrix into separate files.
SplitColumns allows users to extract specific columns from a data matrix by specifying column numbers or ranges.
The SplitColumns module supports flexible column selection, including individual columns, ranges, and open-ended ranges like "4-" to select all columns from column 4 onward.
SplitColumns can optionally include additional columns in each output file to provide context or related information.
The module generates output files with a naming convention of <output.prefix>_<column_number>.splitcol.txt.
SplitColumns uses either Unix cut command or Perl for column extraction, ensuring broad compatibility across different computing environments.
The module is designed for preprocessing and utility tasks in data analysis workflows, particularly in genomic and biological research contexts.
SplitColumns is compatible with Mac and Linux operating systems and can run on any CPU architecture.
The module was initially developed in September 2012 and provides a simple, flexible method for column-based data extraction.
Users can specify columns to split using comma-separated lists or ranges, making it adaptable to various data matrix structures.
