STAR.aligner is on version 2.5.3a.
A description of STAR.aligner is STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a fast RNA-seq reads to genome mapper. It differs from other mappers as TopHat in that it gains speed at the expense of consuming more RAM and that it incorporates transcriptome annotation at the indexing build stage rather than at the analysis stage..
STAR.aligner is a GenePattern module written by Guy Bottu, V.I.B.-B.I.T.S. (GenePattern interface); Alexander Dobin, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (STAR software).
STAR.aligner can be categorized as RNA-seq, Alignment, Bioinformatics.
STAR.aligner has the following parameters: star index, reads pair 1, reads pair 2, max reads to align, align read end to end, max number mismatches, max fraction mistaches, min overhang annotated read, min overhang not annotated read, min intron length, max intron length, mates max gap, secondary mapping mismatches range, max multimapping, min report canonical junction overhang, min report noncanonical junction overhang, map only reported juntions, tow pass, detect chimeric transcripts, output unmapped reads, quantify genes, output wiggle file, wiggle signal, output format, HI flag, output prefix.
The STAR.aligner is a specialized RNA-seq read alignment tool in the GenePattern bioinformatics platform.
STAR.aligner uses an ultrafast algorithm to map RNA sequencing reads to a reference genome with high precision.
The STAR.aligner can detect both annotated and novel splice junctions during the alignment process.
STAR.aligner supports two-pass alignment mode, which allows for more sensitive detection of splice junctions across multiple samples.
The STAR.aligner can handle both single-end and paired-end sequencing data in fastA and fastQ formats.
STAR.aligner generates multiple output files including alignment logs, mapped read files, splice junction information, and optional gene quantification data.
The STAR.aligner can produce visualization-friendly output like wiggle files for genome browsers such as IGV and UCSC.
STAR.aligner allows users to customize alignment parameters like maximum mismatches, intron length, and mapping specificity.
The module supports chimeric transcript detection and can output reads that map to multiple genomic locations.
STAR.aligner is particularly useful for RNA-seq experiments involving complex transcriptomes with multiple splice variants.

STAR.aligner is a fast RNA-seq read alignment tool that maps sequencing reads to a reference genome.
STAR.aligner uses an uncompressed suffix array to quickly find perfect sequence matches between reads and the genome.
The STAR.aligner algorithm extends initial perfect matches into "seed" alignments, allowing for mismatches and gaps.
STAR.aligner can detect novel splice junctions and chimeric transcripts during the alignment process.
STAR.aligner supports a two-pass alignment mode that first detects novel junctions and then re-maps reads using the discovered junctions.
The STAR.aligner module can use shared memory to optimize computational efficiency when multiple runs use the same genome index.
STAR.aligner requires a pre-built genome index and input sequencing reads in FASTQ or FASTA format.
STAR.aligner can handle both single-end and paired-end sequencing data.
The module allows users to control alignment parameters like maximum mismatches, intron length, and multi-mapping behavior.
STAR.aligner generates multiple output files, including alignment mappings, splice junction information, and optional gene quantification.
The module can produce wiggle files for visualization of RNA-seq signal across the genome.
STAR.aligner supports output in various formats including SAM, BAM, and sorted BAM.
The tool is particularly optimized for mammalian genome alignments but can be adapted for other organisms.
STAR.aligner can optionally detect and report chimeric transcripts during the alignment process.
The module provides detailed logging files that track the alignment process and mapping statistics.
