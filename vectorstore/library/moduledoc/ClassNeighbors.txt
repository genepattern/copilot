ClassNeighbors is on version 1.0.
A description of ClassNeighbors is Select genes that most closely resemble a profile. The ClassNeighbors tool performs marker analysis that helps the user determine which genes are most closely correlated with a class template and how significant that correlation is for each gene..
ClassNeighbors is a GenePattern module written by Ken Ross (Broad Institute) kross@broad.mit.edu.
ClassNeighbors can be categorized as GeneListSelection.
ClassNeighbors has the following parameters: data.filename, class.filename, marker.gene.list.file, marker.data.set.file, num.neighbors, num.permutations, user.pval, min.threshold, max.threshold, min.fold.diff, min.abs.diff, mean.or.median, ttest.or.snr.
The ClassNeighbors GenePattern module is a powerful tool for identifying genes most closely correlated with a specific biological class or phenotype.
ClassNeighbors helps researchers identify marker genes that distinguish between two different biological conditions or classes.
The module uses statistical methods like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or t-Test to rank genes based on their differential expression between classes.
ClassNeighbors performs a permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the identified marker genes, controlling for both gene ranking and inter-gene correlations.
The module can filter genes based on variation, removing genes that do not show substantial differences across samples.
ClassNeighbors is particularly useful in cancer research, helping to identify genes that can distinguish between tumor and normal tissue samples.
The algorithm produces a detailed output table with 12 columns, including gene expression statistics, permutation test results, and gene identifiers.
Researchers can customize the analysis by setting parameters like the number of neighbors, permutation iterations, and significance thresholds.
ClassNeighbors can be integrated with other GenePattern modules like HeatMapViewer to visualize the results of the marker gene analysis.
The module is based on seminal work in molecular classification by researchers like Golub and colleagues, who pioneered gene expression-based cancer classification.
ClassNeighbors provides a systematic approach to identifying genes that are most informative for distinguishing between different biological classes or conditions.
The module's flexibility allows researchers to apply it to various biological questions, from cancer research to studying developmental processes.

Here are the input and output files for the ClassNeighbors module:
ClassNeighbors input data file is a gene expression matrix in .res, .gct, or .odf format containing gene expression measurements across samples.
ClassNeighbors input class file is a .cls or .odf file defining sample class labels for two distinct groups to compare.
ClassNeighbors marker gene list output file is an .odf file containing ranked genes with statistical significance metrics for each class.
ClassNeighbors marker data set output file is a .gct format file with raw expression data for the selected marker genes.
ClassNeighbors input data file contains numerical gene expression values with genes as rows and samples as columns.
ClassNeighbors input class file contains binary class labels indicating which samples belong to each group being compared.
ClassNeighbors marker gene list output file includes columns for gene name, class correlation, signal-to-noise score, mean values, standard deviations, and permutation test significance levels.
ClassNeighbors marker data set output file preserves the original expression data format for the subset of selected marker genes.
ClassNeighbors input files must have consistent sample ordering to enable proper class comparison and statistical analysis.
ClassNeighbors output files provide a comprehensive summary of genes most correlated with the specified class distinction.

ClassNeighbors uses statistical methods like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and t-Test to rank genes based on their differential expression between classes.
The module performs a permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the identified marker genes, controlling for both gene ranking and inter-gene correlations.
ClassNeighbors generates an output table with 12 columns, including class label, statistical scores, mean and standard deviation for each class, and permutation-based significance levels.
The algorithm includes data preprocessing options like thresholding and variation filtering to improve the quality of gene selection.
ClassNeighbors can help researchers identify genes that are most characteristic of a particular biological state, such as tumor versus normal tissue.
The module allows users to specify the number of neighbors (genes) to analyze and the number of permutations for statistical testing.
Users can choose between using mean or median values and between Signal-to-Noise Ratio or t-Test for feature selection.
The algorithm preserves the correlation structure of the original data during the permutation process, ensuring robust statistical inference.
ClassNeighbors is particularly useful in molecular classification studies, such as cancer research, where identifying distinguishing gene markers is crucial.
The module can be used to discover genes that are significantly different between two biological classes, helping to understand underlying molecular mechanisms.
