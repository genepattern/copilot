GeneNeighbors is on version 1.0.
A description of GeneNeighbors is Select features that most closely resemble or differ from another feature. The GeneNeighbors module calculates the nearest neighbors for a particular gene (or other continuous vector pseudo-gene) by trying to find other genes whose expression values follow similar trends for the samples..
GeneNeighbors is a GenePattern module written by Ken Ross (Broad Institute).
GeneNeighbors can be categorized as GeneListSelection.
GeneNeighbors has the following parameters: Dataset, gene.accession, num.neighbors, marker.list.file, marker.dataset.file, distance.metric, filter.data, min.threshold, max.threshold, min.fold.diff, min.abs.diff.
The GeneNeighbors module helps researchers identify genes with similar expression patterns across multiple samples.
The GeneNeighbors module calculates the nearest neighbors for a specific gene by comparing its expression values across different samples.
Users can specify the number of nearest neighbors they want to find for a particular gene using the num.neighbors parameter.
GeneNeighbors supports four different distance metrics for comparing gene expression: Cosine, Euclidean, Manhattan, and Pearson correlation.
The Cosine distance metric measures the similarity between gene expression vectors by calculating the angle between them in a multi-dimensional space.
The Euclidean distance metric calculates the straight-line distance between gene expression vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
The Manhattan distance metric measures the total absolute difference between gene expression values across all samples.
The Pearson correlation metric assesses the linear relationship between two gene expression profiles, indicating how closely they trend together.
GeneNeighbors produces an output table with two columns: the gene identifier and its calculated distance score relative to the reference gene.
The results from GeneNeighbors can be further visualized using complementary GenePattern modules like GeneListSignificanceViewer and HeatMapViewer.
Researchers can use GeneNeighbors to identify genes with similar expression patterns, which can provide insights into potential functional relationships or shared biological processes.
The module allows filtering of data based on minimum and maximum thresholds to focus on genes with significant expression levels.
GeneNeighbors is particularly useful in cancer research, where identifying genes with similar expression patterns can help understand molecular classification and potential biomarkers.
The module is part of the GenePattern suite, a comprehensive bioinformatics platform for analyzing genomic data.

GeneNeighbors is a computational method for identifying genes with similar expression patterns across multiple samples.
The GeneNeighbors module calculates similarity between genes using different distance metrics like Cosine, Euclidean, Manhattan, and Pearson correlation.
Users can specify a reference gene and the number of nearest neighbors they want to find based on expression similarity.
The algorithm compares expression values across all samples to determine how closely different genes' expression trends match.
Distance metrics quantify the similarity between gene expression profiles using mathematical calculations involving sample-wise comparisons.
The Cosine distance metric measures the angular separation between gene expression vectors in multi-dimensional sample space.
The Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line geometric distance between gene expression profiles across samples.
Manhattan distance measures the total absolute difference in expression values between genes across all samples.
Pearson correlation assesses the linear relationship between two genes' expression patterns, accounting for variations in scale.
GeneNeighbors produces an output table ranking genes by their similarity score to the reference gene, ordered from most to least similar.
The module allows filtering of genes based on expression thresholds and fold differences to focus on biologically meaningful similarities.
Results can be visualized using complementary tools like GeneListSignificanceViewer and HeatMapViewer for further analysis.
The algorithm is based on computational methods developed in cancer classification research for identifying gene expression patterns.
GeneNeighbors works with various input file formats like .gct and .res, making it flexible for different gene expression datasets.
The module is implemented in Java and can run on multiple operating systems, requiring Java JVM version 1.5 or higher.
