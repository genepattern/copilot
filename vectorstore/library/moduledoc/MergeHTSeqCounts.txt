MergeHTSeqCounts is on version 1.
A description of MergeHTSeqCounts is This module takes the read count output from HTSeq for multiple samples and creates a single GCT file. Optionally you can include a sampleInfo file which contains one column with the count file basenames, one column to be used to differentiate the samples for a CLS file and optionally a column with a sample name to use in the gct file..
MergeHTSeqCounts is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire, Ted Liefeld.
MergeHTSeqCounts can be categorized as RNA-seq.
MergeHTSeqCounts has the following parameters: input files, output prefix, sampleinfo file, filenames column, class division column, sample name column.
The MergeHTSeqCounts module in GenePattern is designed to consolidate RNA-seq read count data from multiple samples into a single, unified file format.
The MergeHTSeqCounts module helps researchers combine HTSeq count data files, which typically contain gene expression measurements across different experimental conditions.
MergeHTSeqCounts can transform raw read count data from multiple samples into a standardized GCT (Gene Cluster Text) file format, facilitating downstream analysis and visualization.
The module allows optional inclusion of a sample information file, which can provide additional metadata about each sample, such as experimental condition or phenotype.
MergeHTSeqCounts enables researchers to generate a comprehensive class file (CLS) that categorizes samples based on specified phenotypic or experimental characteristics.
By merging HTSeq count files, the MergeHTSeqCounts module simplifies the process of preparing RNA-seq data for further computational analysis, such as differential gene expression studies.
The module supports flexible sample naming, allowing users to replace default filename-based sample names with more descriptive labels from a sample information file.
MergeHTSeqCounts is particularly useful in bioinformatics workflows that require consolidated gene expression data across multiple experimental conditions or biological replicates.
The GenePattern MergeHTSeqCounts module provides a standardized approach to aggregating RNA-seq read count data, making it easier to compare and analyze gene expression across different samples.
MergeHTSeqCounts module requires input files containing HTSeq read count data for multiple samples.
Input files must be tab-delimited text files with gene symbols and read counts.
The output prefix parameter specifies the base name for generated output files.
The sampleinfo file is an optional file containing metadata about input samples.
Filenames column identifies which column in the sample info file contains input file names.
Class division column specifies a phenotype column for generating a class file.
Sample name column allows custom sample naming in the output GCT file.
MergeHTSeqCounts module supports renaming samples using metadata from the sample info file.
The module generates a single GCT file combining read counts from multiple input files.
Optional sample info file enables automatic class file generation for input samples.
MergeHTSeqCounts supports flexible sample metadata handling for RNA-seq analysis.
The module requires Python 2.6 and works on any operating system and CPU type.
Output includes a GCT format file with merged read count data from input files.
Sample info file can provide custom sample names and phenotype information.
MergeHTSeqCounts simplifies consolidation of HTSeq read count data across multiple samples.
MergeHTSeqCounts module processes HTSeq read count files into a single GCT file.
Input file 1: HTSeq read count text files containing gene symbols and read counts.
Input file 2: Optional sample info file with columns for filenames, class division, and sample names.
Output file 1: Merged GCT file containing read counts for multiple samples.
Output file 2: Optional CLS file generated from sample info file's class division column.
HTSeq read count input files are tab-delimited with two columns: gene identifier and read count.
Sample info file can include columns for matching input files, defining sample classes, and specifying sample names.
GCT output file will contain merged read count data with genes as rows and samples as columns.
CLS file will contain class information for samples if a class division column is provided.
MergeHTSeqCounts supports optional renaming of samples using the sample info file.
Input files can be provided as individual text files or from a directory of HTSeq count files.
Module requires Python 2.6 and can run on any operating system or CPU type.
MergeHTSeqCounts is a GenePattern module for combining multiple HTSeq read count files into a single GCT file.
The MergeHTSeqCounts module allows researchers to consolidate RNA-seq read count data from multiple samples into a unified format.
Input files for MergeHTSeqCounts are tab-delimited text files containing gene symbols and their corresponding read counts from HTSeq analysis.
The module can optionally incorporate a sample information file to provide additional metadata about the input samples.
MergeHTSeqCounts supports renaming samples in the output GCT file using a specified column from the sample information file.
Users can generate a class file (CLS) for the samples based on a phenotype column in the sample information file.
The module automatically handles file extensions and naming conventions for the output files.
MergeHTSeqCounts is written in Python 2.6 and can run on any operating system with compatible Python support.
The module is currently in beta release, indicating that some features may be subject to change or refinement.
Researchers can use MergeHTSeqCounts to streamline the process of consolidating RNA-seq read count data from multiple samples.
The output of MergeHTSeqCounts is a GCT file, which is a standard format for gene expression data in bioinformatics research.
