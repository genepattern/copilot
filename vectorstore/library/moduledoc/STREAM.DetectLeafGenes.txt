STREAM.DetectLeafGenes is a computational method for identifying marker genes in single-cell trajectory analysis.
STREAM is a pipeline for reconstructing and visualizing complex branching trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data.
The STREAM.DetectLeafGenes module focuses on detecting unique gene expression patterns at the terminal branches of a cellular trajectory.
The algorithm first scales gene expression values to a normalized range between 0 and 1 for consistent comparison.
For each gene, the module calculates average expression levels across all leaf branches of a cellular trajectory.
The method computes Z-scores for gene expression in leaf branches to identify statistically significant differences.
Genes with an absolute Z-score greater than 1.5 in any leaf branch are considered potential marker candidates.
A Kruskal-Wallis H-test is used to determine if there are statistically significant differences in gene expression between leaf branches.
If the Kruskal-Wallis test shows significant differences, a post-hoc Conover's test is performed for pairwise comparisons.
Genes that show significant expression differences specifically in a candidate leaf branch are designated as leaf genes.
The module can filter gene expressions based on a percentile threshold to remove extreme or potentially noisy expression values.
STREAM.DetectLeafGenes produces output files including a pickle file with analysis results and TSV files listing identified leaf genes.
The method was developed to help researchers understand cellular differentiation and transition processes in complex biological systems.
The algorithm is particularly useful for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from developmental or differentiation studies.
STREAM.DetectLeafGenes can be customized with parameters like root node selection and expression percentile thresholds.
The module is part of a larger STREAM pipeline designed for comprehensive single-cell trajectory analysis.
