CARTXValidation is on version 3.
A description of CARTXValidation is Tree-based regression and classification with leave-one-out cross validation. CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables (regression) and categorical predictor variables (classification). It works by recursively splitting the feature space into non-overlapping regions and predicting the most likely value of the dependent variable within each region..
