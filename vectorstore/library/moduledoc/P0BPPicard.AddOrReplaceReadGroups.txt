Picard.AddOrReplaceReadGroups module requires a SAM or BAM input file containing sequencing read data.
Input file is a standard SAM or BAM format genomic alignment file with existing read group information.
Input file must contain complete sequencing read alignment records with header and alignment details.
Input file can be generated from high-throughput sequencing platforms like Illumina, SOLID, or other next-generation sequencing technologies.
Output file is a modified SAM or BAM file with replaced read group information specified by user parameters.
Output file maintains the same genomic alignment data as input file but with updated read group metadata.
Output file preserves original read alignment positions, mapping quality, and other core sequencing information.
Output file filename is determined by the user-specified output prefix parameter.
Output file format matches the input file format (SAM or BAM).
Read group parameters like library, platform, sample name are used to annotate the new read group in the output file.
The module supports processing of genomic alignment files across different sequencing platforms and experimental designs.
