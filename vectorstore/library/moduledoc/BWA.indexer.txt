BWA.indexer is on version 2.
A description of BWA.indexer is Creates a BWT index from a sequence FASTA file for use with the BWA 0.7.4 aligners. This module takes a sequence files in FASTA format, and outputs a set of 5 files in a ZIP archive. These files together constitute the index..
BWA.indexer is a GenePattern module written by Heng Li, Broad Institute.
BWA.indexer can be categorized as RNA-seq.
BWA.indexer has the following parameters: fasta file, algorithm, output prefix.
The BWA.indexer module is a critical bioinformatics tool for preparing genomic sequences for alignment analysis.
The BWA.indexer creates a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) index from DNA sequence data stored in FASTA format.
The BWA.indexer generates five specialized index files that enable rapid genomic sequence alignment using the BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) algorithm.
The BWA.indexer supports two different indexing algorithms: IS (for smaller genomes) and bwtsw (for larger genomes like the human genome).
The BWA.indexer requires a FASTA file as input and produces a ZIP archive containing the index files necessary for subsequent alignment processes.
The BWA.indexer is particularly useful in next-generation sequencing workflows, especially for RNA-seq and genomic mapping experiments.
The BWA.indexer can handle genomes of varying sizes, with different memory and computational requirements depending on the chosen indexing algorithm.
The BWA.indexer is compatible with BWA versions 0.6.x and 0.7.x, but not with older versions like 0.5.x, which have different indexing formats.
The BWA.indexer was developed by researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute, key centers in genomic research.
The BWA.indexer is a crucial preprocessing step that enables fast and accurate short read alignment in genomic research and clinical sequencing applications.
fasta_file: file, Required input FASTA file for BWA indexer containing DNA sequences to be indexed.
algorithm: string, Required parameter specifying BWT index construction method, with two options: "is" (faster, smaller genomes) or "bwtsw" (supports whole human genome).
output_prefix: string, Required parameter defining the base filename for generated index files in the output ZIP archive.
is algorithm: Uses linear-time suffix array construction method, requires 5.27*N memory, works best for databases under 2GB.
bwtsw algorithm: Supports whole human genome indexing, requires more computational resources, works with databases larger than 10MB.
BWA indexer generates five index files packaged in a ZIP archive for use with BWA alignment tools.
Index files are not backwards compatible across different BWA versions, with compatibility varying between 0.5.x, 0.6.x, and 0.7.x releases.
Indexing human genome sequences requires approximately 5GB memory and takes around 3 hours using the bwtsw algorithm.
BWA.indexer input FASTA file contains DNA sequences in standard FASTA format with header lines starting with '>' followed by sequence identifier and sequence data.
BWA.indexer input FASTA file must contain valid DNA sequences using standard nucleotide characters A, T, C, G.
BWA.indexer input FASTA file can represent genomic sequences from any organism or genetic source.
BWA.indexer output ZIP archive contains five index files generated using specified BWT indexing algorithm.
BWA.indexer output .amb file contains sequence length and other metadata about the indexed sequences.
BWA.indexer output .ann file contains annotation information for the indexed sequences.
BWA.indexer output .bwt file contains the Burrows-Wheeler transformed sequence data.
BWA.indexer output .pac file contains the packed representation of the original sequence.
BWA.indexer output .sa file contains the suffix array index for rapid sequence alignment.
BWA.indexer output index files are specific to BWA version 0.6.x and newer alignment algorithms.
BWA.indexer output ZIP archive enables efficient genomic sequence indexing for subsequent alignment processes.
BWA.indexer is a GenePattern module for creating a Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) index from DNA sequence FASTA files.
The BWA.indexer module generates a compressed index used for rapid genomic sequence alignment.
BWA.indexer supports two indexing algorithms: IS (for smaller genomes) and bwtsw (for larger genomes like the human genome).
The IS algorithm requires 5.27*N memory and works best for databases smaller than 2GB, while bwtsw can handle whole genome indexing.
BWA.indexer produces a ZIP archive containing five essential index files with extensions .amb, .ann, .bwt, .pac, and .sa.
The module was developed collaboratively by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute.
Indexing the human genome with the bwtsw algorithm requires approximately 5GB of memory and takes around 3 hours to complete.
BWA.indexer is compatible with BWA version 0.6.x and 0.7.x index files, but not with older 0.5.x versions.
The module is based on the BWA algorithm developed by Heng Li and Richard Durbin, which uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform for efficient sequence alignment.
Users must provide a FASTA file containing DNA sequences and specify an output file prefix when using the BWA.indexer module.
