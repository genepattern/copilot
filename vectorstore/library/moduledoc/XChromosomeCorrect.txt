XChromosomeCorrect is on version .
A description of XChromosomeCorrect is Corrects SNP values on the X chromosome for samples from male donors. For each sample from a male donor, the XChromosomeCorrect module doubles the intensity value for each SNP on the X chromosome..
XChromosomeCorrect is a GenePattern module written by David Twomey and Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
XChromosomeCorrect can be categorized as SNP Analysis.
XChromosomeCorrect has the following parameters: snp filename, sample info filename, output file.
The XChromosomeCorrect module is a specialized bioinformatics tool for correcting X chromosome SNP intensity values in genetic analysis.
XChromosomeCorrect addresses a key genetic difference between male and female samples by adjusting X chromosome SNP intensities.
The module specifically handles intensity correction for male donors, who have only one X chromosome, by doubling the SNP intensity values.
XChromosomeCorrect requires a non-allele-specific .snp file as input, which contains single intensity values for genetic probes.
The module uses a sample information file to determine the gender of each sample, which is critical for applying the X chromosome correction.
XChromosomeCorrect is designed to work within the GenePattern computational genomics platform, facilitating standardized genetic data processing.
The correction process is particularly important for genetic studies involving sex chromosomes, ensuring more accurate comparative analysis across male and female samples.
By doubling X chromosome SNP intensities for male samples, XChromosomeCorrect helps normalize genetic data and account for chromosomal differences.
The module is platform-independent, running on any operating system and CPU architecture, making it widely accessible for genetic research.
XChromosomeCorrect generates an output .snp file with corrected intensity values, which can be used in subsequent genetic analysis workflows.
snp filename, file, XChromosomeCorrect requires a non-allele-specific GenePattern .snp file with one intensity value per probe, required, no default value
sample info filename, file, XChromosomeCorrect needs a tab-delimited sample information file specifying sample names and gender, required, no default value
output file, string, XChromosomeCorrect generates the corrected .snp file with modified X chromosome intensity values, optional, default is input-file.xcorrected.snp
XChromosomeCorrect module processes SNP data by doubling X chromosome intensity for male samples
XChromosomeCorrect requires precise column labels in sample information file: "Sample" and "Gender"
XChromosomeCorrect supports gender-specific correction for X chromosome SNP intensity values
XChromosomeCorrect handles non-allele-specific SNP files from Affymetrix SNP chip data
XChromosomeCorrect ensures accurate genetic analysis by adjusting X chromosome signal intensity for male donors
XChromosomeCorrect module input file is a non-allele-specific GenePattern .snp file with one intensity value per probe.
XChromosomeCorrect module input sample information file is a tab-delimited text file with sample names and gender information.
XChromosomeCorrect module requires sample information file to have columns labeled "Sample" and "Gender" with exact case and spacing.
XChromosomeCorrect module sample information file uses "M" or "F" to indicate donor gender.
XChromosomeCorrect module output file is a modified .snp file with doubled X chromosome SNP intensity values for male samples.
XChromosomeCorrect module output .snp file follows same format as input file, but with corrected X chromosome intensity values.
XChromosomeCorrect module default output filename appends ".xcorrected.snp" to the input filename.
XChromosomeCorrect module input .snp file is typically created using the SNPFileCreator module from Affymetrix CEL files.
XChromosomeCorrect module processes SNP intensity data specifically for correcting X chromosome measurements in male samples.
XChromosomeCorrect is a computational genomics module designed to adjust X chromosome SNP intensity values for male samples.
The module corrects SNP intensity measurements specifically for male donors by doubling X chromosome probe signal intensities.
XChromosomeCorrect requires a non-allele-specific GenePattern .snp file as input, which contains single intensity values per genetic probe.
The module needs an accompanying sample information file that specifies sample names and gender, with gender designated as 'M' or 'F' for each sample.
XChromosomeCorrect performs a targeted correction for male samples, effectively normalizing X chromosome genetic signal intensity.
The module is implemented in Java and can run on any computational platform, making it widely accessible for genetic research.
Output from XChromosomeCorrect is a modified .snp file with corrected X chromosome intensity values for male samples.
The correction process is designed to address potential signal intensity discrepancies arising from the unique genetic configuration of male X chromosomes.
XChromosomeCorrect is particularly useful in genetic studies involving sex-linked genetic variations and X chromosome analysis.
The module was developed by researchers David Twomey and Joshua Gould to improve genetic data preprocessing for SNP chip experiments.
