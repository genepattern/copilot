VoomNormalize is on version 1.2.
A description of VoomNormalize is Preprocess RNA-Seq count data in a GCT file so that it is suitable for use in GenePattern analyses. Many of these tools were originally designed to handle microarray data - particularly from Affymetrix arrays - and so we must be mindful of that origin when preprocessing data for use with them. The module does this by using a mean-variance modeling technique to transform the dataset to fit an approximation of a normal distribution, with the goal of thus being able to apply classic normal-based microarray-oriented statistical methods and workflows..
VoomNormalize is a GenePattern module written by Arthur Liberzon, David Eby, Edwin Ju√°rez.
VoomNormalize can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
VoomNormalize has the following parameters: input file, cls file, output file, expression value filter threshold.
The VoomNormalize module is a specialized RNA-Seq data preprocessing tool in GenePattern for transforming raw count data.
VoomNormalize helps convert raw RNA-Seq count data into a format compatible with microarray-oriented statistical methods.
The module uses the 'voom' method from the Bioconductor 'limma' package to normalize and transform RNA-Seq data.
VoomNormalize first filters out features with low read counts using a counts per million (CPM) threshold approach.
The module applies Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) normalization to the remaining features in the RNA-Seq dataset.
VoomNormalize transforms RNA-Seq count data to approximate a normal distribution, enabling use of classic statistical techniques.
The module requires raw read count data as input, specifically avoiding pre-normalized metrics like RPKM or FPKM.
VoomNormalize generates two output files: a preprocessed GCT file and a log2 normalized version of the dataset.
The module is designed to prepare RNA-Seq data for downstream analyses in tools like GSEA, ComparativeMarkerSelection, and NMFConsensus.
VoomNormalize automatically determines the smallest group of samples for filtering based on the provided categorical classification file.
The preprocessing technique implemented by VoomNormalize helps address the inherent variability and non-normal distribution of RNA-Seq count data.
input file: file type GCT, contains raw RNA-Seq counts from MergeHTSeqCounts, required parameter for VoomNormalize module
cls file: categorical file specifying phenotype classes for samples in GCT, required parameter for VoomNormalize module
output file: name of output file to be generated, required parameter for VoomNormalize module
expression value filter threshold: numeric value used to filter CPM expression values, determines which rows are kept based on threshold, optional parameter with default value, part of VoomNormalize preprocessing
VoomNormalize module requires raw read count data that has not been previously normalized
VoomNormalize performs filtering of features with low read counts using counts per million (CPM) calculation
VoomNormalize applies Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) normalization to remaining features
VoomNormalize transforms data using 'voom' method to approximate normal distribution for downstream analysis
VoomNormalize converts data to logCPM (log2 counts per million) for compatibility with microarray-oriented statistical methods
VoomNormalize module requires a raw RNA-Seq count data input file in GCT format.
The input GCT file should contain unprocessed read counts from tools like HTSeq or RSEM.
VoomNormalize requires a categorical CLS file specifying phenotype classes for samples.
The CLS file maps samples to their experimental or clinical groupings.
VoomNormalize produces a preprocessed GCT file with fewer rows after filtering low-count features.
The output preprocessed GCT file contains normalized read counts transformed using the voom method.
VoomNormalize also generates a log2 normalized GCT file with transformed gene expression values.
The log2 normalized file allows downstream analysis using microarray-oriented statistical methods.
Input files for VoomNormalize must be raw RNA-Seq counts, not already normalized RPKM or FPKM values.
The module filters out features with less than 1 read per million in the smallest sample group.
VoomNormalize applies Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) normalization to remaining features.
The output files represent gene expression data prepared for further computational analysis.

VoomNormalize transforms the data to approximate a normal distribution using the 'voom' method.
The output is a dataset with values in log2 counts per million (logCPM) that can be used with standard microarray statistical methods.
The module requires two input files: a GCT file with raw RNA-Seq counts and a CLS file specifying sample phenotype classes.
VoomNormalize generates two output files: a preprocessed GCT file and a log2 normalized GCT file.
The module runs on R-3.1.3 and requires specific R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor.
VoomNormalize is part of the GenePattern suite of computational genomics tools.
The module follows recommendations from published literature on RNA-Seq data normalization and transformation.
