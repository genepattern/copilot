ExtractFCSParameters is on version 2.
A description of ExtractFCSParameters is Extracts specified parameters from a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file. Sometimes, an FCS data file may contain several parameters (data dimensions) that are not relevant for a given analysis. This module allows you to extract specified parameters from an FCS data file and save these in a new FCS data file..
ExtractFCSParameters is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca), gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
ExtractFCSParameters can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
ExtractFCSParameters has the following parameters: Input FCS data file, Parameters to extract, Output file name.
The ExtractFCSParameters module allows researchers to selectively extract specific parameters from flow cytometry data files.
The ExtractFCSParameters module helps reduce data complexity by allowing targeted extraction of relevant flow cytometry measurements.
Flow cytometry researchers can use ExtractFCSParameters to focus analysis on specific cellular characteristics like size, granularity, or fluorescence markers.
The ExtractFCSParameters module supports parameter selection through either numerical indexes or parameter short names like FSC-H, SSC-H, or FL1-A.
By extracting only needed parameters, the ExtractFCSParameters module can reduce computational processing time and memory requirements for downstream flow cytometry analyses.
The ExtractFCSParameters module is compatible with FCS 3.1 file standards and can handle large datasets with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters.
Bioinformaticians and flow cytometry analysts can use ExtractFCSParameters to streamline data preprocessing and focus on specific cellular populations of interest.
The ExtractFCSParameters module generates a new FCS file containing only the selected parameters while preserving all original events from the source file.
Researchers using ExtractFCSParameters can customize their flow cytometry data analysis by selectively including or excluding specific measurement dimensions.
The ExtractFCSParameters module provides flexibility in parameter selection, supporting both numeric ranges (e.g., 1-3) and specific parameter names.

ExtractFCSParameters module input and output file descriptions:
Input FCS file contains raw flow cytometry data with multiple parameters and events recorded in FCS 3.0 or 3.1 file format.
Input parameter list specifies which parameters to extract, using either numeric indexes or parameter short names like FSC-H or SSC-H.
Output FCS file contains a subset of parameters from the original input file, preserving all original events but only including selected parameters.
Output file maintains the standard FCS file structure with reduced parameter dimensionality.
Input FCS file typically includes multiple measurement channels for cell characteristics like size, granularity, and fluorescence intensity.
Input parameter list allows flexible selection of specific parameters for focused flow cytometry analysis.
Output FCS file enables researchers to streamline data for specific analytical workflows by removing irrelevant parameters.
Output file preserves the original event count and data integrity while reducing computational complexity.
Input FCS file can contain up to 24 parameters and 1,000,000 events based on module performance estimates.
Output file size will be smaller than the input file due to reduced parameter count.
ExtractFCSParameters is a GenePattern module for selectively extracting specific parameters from Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.
The ExtractFCSParameters module helps researchers reduce complex flow cytometry datasets by removing irrelevant parameters.
Users can specify parameters to extract either by numerical index (like 1-3, 5, 8) or by short parameter names (such as FSC-H, SSC-H).
The module allows researchers to focus on specific cellular characteristics by removing extraneous fluorescence or measurement data.
Extracted parameters are saved in a new FCS file that retains all original events from the source file.
The module supports FCS 3.1 file standard and can handle files with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters.
ExtractFCSParameters requires Java 1.6 or higher and is compatible with any CPU and operating system.
The module issues warnings if specified parameters cannot be found in the source data file.
Maximum resource requirements for ExtractFCSParameters include 1.4 GB of RAM and an estimated runtime of 25 seconds.
The module was developed by Josef Spidlen and is part of the GenePattern flow cytometry analysis toolkit.
