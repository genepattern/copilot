SparseHierarchicalClustering is on version .
A description of SparseHierarchicalClustering is Agglomerative hierarchical clustering of genes/experiments, using the sparse hierarchical clustering method of Witten and Tibshirani (2009)..
SparseHierarchicalClustering is a GenePattern module written by Daniela Witten (Stanford University), dwitten@u.washington.edu.
SparseHierarchicalClustering can be categorized as Clustering.
SparseHierarchicalClustering has the following parameters: input.filename, method, wbound, maxnumgenes, cluster.features, method.features, standardize.arrays.
The SparseHierarchicalClustering module is a powerful bioinformatics tool for advanced gene expression data analysis.
SparseHierarchicalClustering allows researchers to perform hierarchical clustering with an innovative approach that selectively uses only the most relevant genes.
Unlike traditional clustering methods that use all genes, SparseHierarchicalClustering adaptively chooses a subset of genes most important to the clustering process.
The module assigns non-negative weights to genes, with many genes potentially receiving zero weight, indicating they are not critical to the clustering analysis.
SparseHierarchicalClustering helps researchers identify the most important genes in a dataset by ranking them based on their assigned weights.
The module supports multiple linkage methods including single, complete, average, and centroid clustering approaches.
Researchers can control the gene selection process using the 'wbound' parameter, which determines the total weight assigned to genes in the clustering.
SparseHierarchicalClustering can automatically select an optimal tuning parameter if desired, making it flexible for different research needs.
The module can handle large datasets by allowing users to limit the number of genes analyzed, improving computational efficiency.
Output from SparseHierarchicalClustering includes clustering files (CDT, ATR, GTR) and a weights file that details the importance of each gene in the analysis.
This module is particularly useful in genomics research for identifying key genes in complex datasets and reducing noise in clustering results.
SparseHierarchicalClustering provides a framework for feature selection in clustering, helping researchers focus on the most biologically significant genes.
The module can standardize array data before clustering, ensuring more reliable and comparable results across different experiments.
Researchers can choose to cluster both observations (arrays) and features (genes) using this flexible bioinformatics tool.
SparseHierarchicalClustering is implemented in R and can be used across different computing platforms, making it widely accessible to researchers.

Here are the input and output files for the SparseHierarchicalClustering module:
Input Files:
SparseHierarchicalClustering requires a GCT file containing gene expression data to perform clustering.
The GCT file is a tab-delimited matrix representing gene expression measurements across multiple arrays or experiments.
Each row represents a gene, and each column represents an experimental condition or sample.
The first few columns typically contain gene identifier and description information.
The remaining columns contain numerical expression values for each gene across different conditions.
Output Files:
SparseHierarchicalClustering generates a CDT file containing genes with non-zero weights for visualization.
The CDT file includes the subset of genes selected as most relevant for clustering.
SparseHierarchicalClustering produces an ATR file representing the clustering of arrays or observations.
The ATR file contains the hierarchical structure of sample/array relationships.
SparseHierarchicalClustering optionally creates a GTR file if gene clustering is enabled.
The GTR file represents the hierarchical clustering of genes with non-zero weights.
SparseHierarchicalClustering generates a WEIGHTS.TXT file showing the weight assigned to each gene.
The WEIGHTS.TXT file allows users to understand gene importance in the clustering process.
SparseHierarchicalClustering outputs a WBOUND.TXT file with information about the sparse clustering parameters.
The WBOUND.TXT file includes details about the tuning parameter used in the clustering algorithm.
SparseHierarchicalClustering is an advanced clustering method that adaptively selects genes for analysis.
The SparseHierarchicalClustering module allows researchers to perform hierarchical clustering with gene selection.
Unlike standard hierarchical clustering, this method chooses a subset of genes most relevant to the clustering process.
Each gene receives a non-negative weight, with many genes potentially having zero weight if they are not important to the clustering.
The module allows researchers to control gene selection through a tuning parameter called wbound, which determines the total gene weights used.
Researchers can specify different linkage methods like single, complete, average, or centroid clustering for both arrays and features.
The module can automatically select an optimal tuning parameter or allow manual specification of gene weight constraints.
Users can limit the number of genes analyzed to improve computational efficiency, with a default maximum of 5000 genes.
The output includes a CDT file with non-zero weighted genes, an ATR file for array clustering, and optional gene clustering files.
Gene weights can be used to rank the importance of different genes in the clustering analysis.
The method is based on research by Witten and Tibshirani, providing a sophisticated approach to feature selection in clustering.
The module supports standardization of arrays to have zero mean and unit standard deviation before clustering.
Researchers can choose to cluster both observations (arrays) and features (genes) using this flexible method.
The SparseHierarchicalClustering module is implemented in R and can run on any platform with R 2.5 or higher.
