MAGEMLImportViewer module uses a zip file containing MAGE-ML files as input.
Input file is a compressed archive (.tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .zip, .gz) containing MAGE-ML microarray data files.
MAGE-ML input files represent microarray expression data in a standardized XML-based format.
Input files can be downloaded from repositories like ArrayExpress.
MAGEMLImportViewer allows selection of specific BioAssays from the input file.
MAGEMLImportViewer allows selection of specific quantitation types from the input data.
Output file is a .gct (Gene Cluster Text) format file containing selected microarray expression data.
Output .gct file includes selected BioAssays and quantitation types from the original MAGE-ML data.
Output file can be customized with user-specified filename and path.
MAGEMLImportViewer supports common quantitation types like cy5/cy3 ratio, Log2Ratio, and Signal.
Input files can contain data from different microarray platforms like cDNA and Affymetrix.
MAGEMLImportViewer is a GenePattern module for importing microarray expression data in MAGE-ML format.
The MAGEMLImportViewer module allows researchers to convert MAGE-ML data files into a standard GenePattern .gct file format.
MAGE-ML is a standardized format for representing microarray expression data developed by the Microarray Gene Expression Working Group.
The module supports importing data files from repositories like ArrayExpress, which host microarray experimental datasets.
MAGEMLImportViewer provides a multi-step wizard interface for selecting specific bioassays and quantitation types during data import.
Users can choose between derived data (expression values) and raw probe intensity values when importing MAGE-ML files.
The module supports multiple common quantitation types for different microarray platforms, including cDNA and Affymetrix arrays.
For two-color microarray data, typical quantitation types include cy5/cy3 ratio, Log2Ratio, and LOG_RAT2N_MEDIAN.
For Affymetrix data, common quantitation types are Avg Diff, RMA normalized value, and Signal.
The MAGEMLImportViewer module supports compressed archive files like .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .zip, and .gz.
The import process includes five steps: BioAssay selection, quantitation type selection, output file specification, selection summary, and file save confirmation.
The module is implemented in Java and requires Java JVM level 1.4 or higher.
MAGEMLImportViewer is platform-independent and can run on any CPU and operating system.
