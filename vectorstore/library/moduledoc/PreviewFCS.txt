PreviewFCS is on version 2.
A description of PreviewFCS is Allows viewing of structural metadata, parameters, and descriptive statistics from a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data file.
PreviewFCS is a GenePattern module written by Josef Spidlen (jspidlen@bccrc.ca).
PreviewFCS can be categorized as Flow Cytometry.
PreviewFCS has the following parameters: Input fcs data file, Output file format, Output file name.
The PreviewFCS GenePattern module provides a comprehensive overview of Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.
PreviewFCS allows researchers to quickly inspect the structural and statistical metadata contained within flow cytometry data files.
The module can generate detailed reports about FCS files in either HTML or XML format.
PreviewFCS provides key information about flow cytometry datasets, including the total number of events and parameters recorded.
For each parameter in an FCS file, PreviewFCS calculates and reports statistical measures like minimum, maximum, median, mean, and quartile values.
The PreviewFCS module supports analysis of FCS files with up to 1,000,000 events and 24 parameters, requiring a maximum of 2 GB RAM.
PreviewFCS can extract and display all keyword/value pairs embedded within an FCS file, offering comprehensive metadata exploration.
The module supports multiple FCS file versions, with specific documentation referencing the FCS 3.1 file standard.
PreviewFCS is designed to work across different computing platforms, with Java 1.6 or higher as the primary runtime requirement.
Researchers can use PreviewFCS to quickly validate and understand the contents of flow cytometry data files before more complex downstream analyses.
The module provides a spillover matrix report if such information is present in the original FCS file, which is crucial for certain flow cytometry experimental designs.
PreviewFCS generates reports that include detailed information about data acquisition, such as date and time of data collection.
The module helps researchers assess parameter scaling (linear or logarithmic) for each measurement channel in a flow cytometry experiment.
input fcs data file: File, the input FCS file to be previewed, required, no default value

Here are the input and output file descriptions for the PreviewFCS module:
Input FCS file is a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data file containing cellular measurement data from a flow cytometry experiment
Input FCS file contains multiple parameters representing different cellular characteristics measured during flow cytometry analysis
Input FCS file stores event-level data with numerical measurements for each detected cellular particle
Input FCS file follows the FCS 3.1 file standard with specific keyword metadata and numerical data sections
Input FCS file can contain up to 1,000,000 events with up to 24 different parameters
Output HTML file provides a human-readable preview report of the FCS file contents
Output HTML file includes summary statistics for each parameter in the FCS file
Output HTML file displays total number of events, parameters, and acquisition metadata
Output HTML file shows minimum, maximum, median, mean, and quartile values for each parameter
Output HTML file follows transitional XHTML version 1 formatting standards
Output XML file provides a machine-readable preview report of the FCS file contents
Output XML file includes structured metadata about the FCS file parameters
Output XML file contains numerical summary statistics in a parseable format
Output XML file follows transitional XML file standards
Output XML file enables programmatic parsing of FCS file characteristics
