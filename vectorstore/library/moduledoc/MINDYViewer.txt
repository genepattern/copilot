MINDYViewer is on version 1.0.
A description of MINDYViewer is Views the results of MINDY (Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics). This implementation uses results from the MINDY heatmap visualizer in geWorkbench. It displays analysis results showing modulators' impact on transcription factor and target gene interactions..
MINDYViewer is a GenePattern module written by Marc-Danie Nazaire (Broad Institute).
MINDYViewer can be categorized as Visualizer, Genomics, Transcription Analysis.
MINDYViewer has the following parameters: dataset.file, mindy.file.
The MINDYViewer module is a GenePattern visualization tool for analyzing transcriptional interactions and gene modulators.
The MINDYViewer helps researchers explore complex gene regulatory networks by displaying heatmap visualizations of gene expression data.
MINDYViewer generates two side-by-side heatmaps showing gene expression patterns for transcription factors and modulators across different samples.
The color gradient in MINDYViewer heatmaps ranges from dark blue (lowest expression) to dark red (highest expression), allowing intuitive visualization of expression levels.
MINDYViewer provides a quantitative measure of modulator interactions through a conditional mutual information (MI) difference score between -1 and 1.
A negative MI score in MINDYViewer indicates that a modulator gene inhibits the interaction between a transcription factor and target gene.
A positive MI score in MINDYViewer suggests that a modulator gene enhances the interaction between a transcription factor and target gene.
The MINDYViewer module allows researchers to select specific modulators and target genes for detailed exploration of gene regulatory relationships.
MINDYViewer can save heatmap visualizations as PNG image files, facilitating documentation and presentation of gene expression analysis results.
The module is designed to work with output from the MINDY (Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics) computational analysis pipeline.
MINDYViewer supports interactive exploration of gene regulatory networks by allowing users to hover over gene names for additional information.
The module is compatible with various computational platforms and requires Java JVM level 1.5 or higher for execution.
MINDYViewer module requires an input dataset file in .res or .gct format.
MINDYViewer module requires a MINDY output file in .mindy format.
Input dataset file parameter is used to specify the source data for visualization.
MINDY output file parameter contains the analysis results to be displayed in the viewer.
Dataset file is a required parameter for the MINDYViewer module.
MINDY file is a required parameter for the MINDYViewer module.
Input file types support .res and .gct file extensions for data representation.
MINDY output file captures the modulator interaction analysis results.
Dataset file provides the original expression data for analysis visualization.
MINDY file contains computed mutual information and interaction modulation scores.
Here are the input and output file descriptions for the MINDYViewer module:
MINDYViewer module requires a dataset file in .res or .gct format containing gene expression data.
The dataset file for MINDYViewer contains gene expression measurements across multiple samples.
MINDYViewer uses a .mindy input file generated by the MINDY module containing modulator interaction analysis results.
The .mindy file includes mutual information calculations about transcription factor and modulator gene interactions.
MINDYViewer does not generate a specific output file, but allows saving heatmap visualizations as .png image files.
The .png output images represent heatmaps showing gene expression patterns and modulator interactions.
The MINDYViewer module creates interactive visualizations of gene expression and modulator effects.
Heatmap images generated by MINDYViewer display color-coded expression levels across samples.
The MINDYViewer module enables exploration of complex gene interaction networks through visual representation.
The MINDYViewer module is a visualization tool for analyzing transcriptional interactions and gene expression modulators.
The MINDYViewer displays two heatmaps showing gene expression patterns for a specific transcription factor and modulator gene.
The left heatmap represents samples where the modulator gene is least expressed, sorted from lowest to highest transcription factor expression.
The right heatmap represents samples where the modulator gene is most highly expressed, using the same sorting method as the left heatmap.
Color coding in the heatmaps ranges from dark blue (lowest expression) to dark red (highest expression).
The accompanying table shows the conditional mutual information (MI) difference for each target gene, indicating how the modulator affects transcription factor interactions.
A negative MI score suggests the modulator inhibits the interaction between the transcription factor and target gene when highly expressed.
A zero MI score indicates no statistically significant modulation of the transcription factor/target gene interaction.
A positive MI score suggests the modulator enhances the transcription factor/target gene interaction when least expressed.
Users can select different modulator genes using a dropdown menu in the MINDYViewer interface.
Target genes can be filtered using a selection list, allowing users to focus on specific genes of interest.
Heatmap images can be saved in PNG format, with a warning about potential memory issues when saving large gene sets.
Hovering over transcription factor and modulator gene names provides additional descriptive information.
The MINDYViewer is based on research by Wang et al. exploring modulators of transcriptional interactions in human B lymphocytes.
The module requires input files in .res or .gct format and a MINDY output file in .mindy format.
The MINDYViewer is a Java-based visualizer compatible with multiple platforms and requires Java JVM level 1.5 or higher.
