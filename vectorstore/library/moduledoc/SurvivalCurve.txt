SurvivalCurve is on version 3.
A description of SurvivalCurve is Draws survival curve based on cls file. Once a genomics marker or predictive model for clinical outcome is built, the next step is to test whether it really predicts outcome of new cohorts, or whether it has better predictive ability compared to already known clinical markers/predictive models. "Survival analysis" modules perform such analyses seamlessly after clustering/marker gene/prediction analyses..
SurvivalCurve is a GenePattern module written by Yujin Hoshida (Broad Institute) gp-help@broadinstitute.org.
SurvivalCurve can be categorized as Survival Analysis.
SurvivalCurve has the following parameters: input, input cls file, time field, censor field, cls field, print fit results, line type color assign, manual line type, manual line color, line width, time conversion, max time, surv function lower, surv function higher, curve type, show conf interval, add legend, legend position, output filename.
The SurvivalCurve GenePattern module is a powerful tool for generating and analyzing survival curves in biomedical research.
SurvivalCurve allows researchers to visualize the probability of survival over time for different patient groups or experimental conditions.
The module can create survival curves based on clinical data that includes patient survival times and censoring status.
SurvivalCurve supports multiple curve types, including standard survival curves, cumulative hazard, and complementary log-log survival curves.
Researchers can customize the survival curve's appearance by manually or automatically assigning line types, colors, and widths.
The module can convert survival time units (e.g., from days to years) to facilitate easier interpretation of results.
SurvivalCurve generates output files including graphical survival curve plots in PNG or PDF formats.
The module is particularly useful for testing whether genomic markers or predictive models can accurately predict clinical outcomes.
SurvivalCurve can compare survival distributions across different patient classes or experimental groups.
The module provides options to display confidence intervals and legends to enhance the interpretability of survival analysis results.
SurvivalCurve is built using R and can be integrated into broader bioinformatics workflows within the GenePattern platform.
The module requires input files containing patient identifiers, class information, censoring status, and survival times.
Researchers can specify custom parameters like time field names, censoring indicators, and maximum observation time.
SurvivalCurve supports both automatic and manual line type and color assignment for more flexible data visualization.
The module can generate additional text output files with detailed survival estimation results when requested.
