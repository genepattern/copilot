PCA is on version 4.2.
A description of PCA is Performs a principal components analysis. This implementation is an adaptation of the MultiExperiment Viewer PCA analysis (mev.tm4.org)..
PCA is a GenePattern module written by GenePattern Team https://www.genepattern.org/contact, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
PCA can be categorized as Dimension Reduction.
PCA has the following parameters: input_filename, compute_pcs_of, output_file.
The PCA GenePattern module performs Principal Components Analysis to reduce high-dimensional biological data into more interpretable components.
The PCA module allows researchers to transform complex genomic datasets into simplified representations that capture maximum variance.
Principal Components Analysis in GenePattern can be applied to both rows (features) and columns (samples) in a dataset, providing flexibility in data exploration.
The module supports multiple input file formats including .res, .gct, and .odf, making it versatile for different types of genomic and transcriptomic data.
PCA in GenePattern helps researchers identify the most significant sources of variation in large-scale biological datasets, such as gene expression microarrays.
The module generates multiple output matrices including eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and principal components matrices, enabling comprehensive data analysis.
By reducing data dimensionality, the PCA GenePattern module helps researchers visualize complex biological relationships that might be obscured in high-dimensional spaces.
The module is particularly useful in genomics for identifying underlying patterns in gene expression, clustering samples, and understanding biological heterogeneity.
Researchers can use the PCA GenePattern module to compress large datasets while retaining the most important information, facilitating more efficient downstream analyses.
The implementation is adapted from the MultiExperiment Viewer (mev.tm4.org), providing a robust and well-established approach to principal components analysis.
