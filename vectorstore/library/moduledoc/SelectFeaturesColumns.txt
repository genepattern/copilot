SelectFeaturesColumns is on version .
A description of SelectFeaturesColumns is Takes a 'column slice' from a .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, or .cls file. This module generates a new file based on features (columns) selected from an existing file. For example, a res file can be produced containing only the tumor samples from a larger res file containing data for both tumor and normal samples..
SelectFeaturesColumns is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould (Broad Institute), gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
SelectFeaturesColumns can be categorized as GeneListSelection.
SelectFeaturesColumns has the following parameters: input, columns, list, output.
The SelectFeaturesColumns module in GenePattern allows researchers to extract specific columns from various bioinformatics file formats.
The SelectFeaturesColumns module supports multiple file types including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, and .cls files.
SelectFeaturesColumns enables precise selection of features or samples by their numerical index, starting from zero.
Researchers can use SelectFeaturesColumns to isolate specific experimental conditions, such as extracting only tumor samples from a mixed dataset.
The SelectFeaturesColumns module provides flexibility in data subsetting by allowing both direct column number specification and list-based selection.
In bioinformatics workflows, SelectFeaturesColumns helps streamline data preparation by enabling targeted feature extraction.
SelectFeaturesColumns is particularly useful for reducing large datasets to focus on specific experimental groups or conditions of interest.
The module preserves the original file structure and metadata while allowing precise column selection.
Researchers can use SelectFeaturesColumns to create smaller, more manageable datasets for downstream analysis.
The SelectFeaturesColumns module operates independently of specific computational platforms, running on any OS with Java support.
input: filename, string, input file path for .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, or .cls file to slice columns from, required, no default value
columns: string, specifies which columns/features to extract from input file, optional (must provide either columns or list), zero-indexed column selection (e.g. 0-3, 5, 9)
list: filename, string, text file containing column identifiers to select, optional (must provide either columns or list), one identifier per line
output: filename, string, output file path for extracted columns, required, supports .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, .cls file formats
SelectFeaturesColumns module allows extracting specific columns from input data files
SelectFeaturesColumns supports zero-indexed column selection for precise feature extraction
SelectFeaturesColumns can extract columns using explicit column numbers or a list file
SelectFeaturesColumns preserves original file structure when extracting columns
SelectFeaturesColumns works with multiple genomic and data file formats
SelectFeaturesColumns requires either column numbers or a list file for feature selection
SelectFeaturesColumns module supports input files in .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, or .cls formats.
Input file contains multiple columns representing different features or samples.
Input file includes header rows with descriptions and accession information.
Input file can contain numeric or categorical data across multiple columns.
Input file uses zero-based indexing for column selection.
Input file may have multiple data columns per feature.
Input file supports selection of specific columns using numeric indices.
Input list file can specify column selection by providing identifiers.
Output file maintains the same file format as the input file.
Output file contains only the selected columns from the input file.
Output file preserves header and description rows.
Output file reduces the number of columns based on user-specified selection.
Output file retains the original data structure and formatting.
Module allows flexible column selection through direct indexing or list file.
Module supports various genomic and experimental data file types.
Module provides a simple mechanism for extracting specific features or samples.
SelectFeaturesColumns is a GenePattern module for extracting specific columns from various genomic data file formats.
The SelectFeaturesColumns module allows researchers to slice and subset genomic data files by selecting specific features or samples.
This module supports multiple file types including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .odf, and .cls files for column extraction.
Users can specify columns to extract using either numeric indices (starting at zero) or by providing a list file with column identifiers.
The module preserves the original file structure and metadata while extracting only the specified columns of interest.
For example, a researcher could use SelectFeaturesColumns to extract only tumor sample columns from a mixed tumor and normal sample dataset.
The module is flexible, allowing selection of single columns, ranges of columns, or specific non-contiguous columns.
SelectFeaturesColumns requires either a 'columns' parameter specifying column indices or a list file with column identifiers.
The output file will contain the same row structure as the input file, but only with the selected columns/features.
This module is platform-independent, written in Java, and can run on any operating system with a Java runtime environment.
The module is particularly useful for genomic data preprocessing, sample selection, and focused analysis of specific experimental conditions.
