AreaChange is on version .
A description of AreaChange is Calculates fraction of area under the spectrum that is attributable to signal (area after noise removal / original area). This function is used to determine the quality of the input spectrum. The function computes the original area under the spectrum. The noise component of the signal is then subtracted from the spectrum and area recomputed. The function returns the ratio: (area after noise removal / original area)..

AreaChange module is a computational tool for analyzing mass spectrometry spectral data quality by calculating area ratios.
AreaChange evaluates spectrum quality by comparing the original spectral area to the area after noise removal.
The module computes the original area under a mass spectrometry spectrum within specified mass-to-charge (M/Z) range boundaries.
AreaChange subtracts the noise component from the original spectrum to recalculate the spectral area.
The module calculates an area ratio by dividing the noise-removed spectral area by the original spectral area.
Spectra are marked as "selected" if the area ratio meets or exceeds a predefined quality threshold.
Spectra with area ratios below the quality threshold are rejected, unless they exhibit strong, sharp peaks.
The AreaChange module generates an output file containing the area ratio, original area, selection status, and detailed spectral data.
The module uses a low-pass filtering technique to estimate and remove noise from the spectrum.
AreaChange calculates a noise envelope by multiplying the local standard deviation of noise by a specified factor.
The module allows users to define the mass-to-charge range, quality threshold, filter window size, and noise calculation parameters.
Developed by D. R. Mani at the Broad Institute, the AreaChange module is designed for proteomics data analysis.
The module is implemented in R and can run on any computational platform with R installed.
The methodology is based on research by Mani & Gillette published in the IEEE Press publication on data mining applications.
