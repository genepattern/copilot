GlobalAlignment is on version 1.0.
A description of GlobalAlignment is Pairwise alignments of two DNA sequences by dynamic programming. Three dynamic programming algorithms are implemented: Global/Needleman-Wunsch, Local/Smith-Waterman, and Iterative Local..
GlobalAlignment is a GenePattern module written by Michael Kamal (Broad Institute) kamal@broad.mit.edu.
GlobalAlignment can be categorized as Sequence Analysis.
GlobalAlignment has the following parameters: query_fasta_filename, subject_fasta_filename, match, mismatch, gapOpen, gapExtend, minSize, minScore, output_file.
The GlobalAlignment module in GenePattern is a powerful tool for performing pairwise sequence alignments using dynamic programming algorithms.
The GlobalAlignment module implements three key sequence alignment strategies: global, local, and iterative local alignment techniques.
Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) attempts to align entire sequences from end to end, finding the most similar overall sequence match.
Local alignment (Smith-Waterman) identifies the most similar subsequences within two larger sequences, focusing on regions of highest similarity.
Iterative local alignment is a more complex approach that greedily finds multiple non-overlapping local alignments by recursively searching sequence regions.
The module allows researchers to specify custom scoring parameters like match rewards, mismatch penalties, and gap opening/extension costs.
GlobalAlignment supports DNA sequence comparisons using standard FASTA file formats, treating uppercase and lowercase characters identically.
The module is particularly useful in comparative genomics, helping researchers identify sequence homology, evolutionary relationships, and conserved genetic regions.
In bioinformatics research, GlobalAlignment can help detect genetic variations, map gene similarities, and understand molecular evolutionary processes.
The alignment algorithms implemented in GlobalAlignment are fundamental to understanding sequence relationships across different organisms or genetic variants.
Researchers can use GlobalAlignment to explore sequence conservation, identify potential functional genetic regions, and study genetic diversity.
The module's flexible scoring parameters allow fine-tuned alignment strategies tailored to specific research questions and sequence characteristics.
GlobalAlignment is platform-independent, running on any system with a Java Virtual Machine, making it widely accessible to researchers.
The module only considers forward sequence orientations, focusing on direct sequence comparisons without reverse complement searching.
By supporting multiple alignment strategies, GlobalAlignment provides researchers with versatile tools for in-depth genetic sequence analysis.

Subject FASTA file is a single-record DNA sequence file containing valid sequence characters A, T, G, C, and N
Input sequences are case-insensitive and treat uppercase and lowercase letters identically
Input sequences can contain N characters representing unknown bases
Input FASTA files must contain only one sequence record per file
Output alignment file is a text file containing detailed alignment results
Output alignment file includes alignment score, aligned sequences, and alignment details
Output alignment file format is plain text with human-readable alignment information
Match score parameter determines positive scoring for matching nucleotides
Mismatch score parameter determines negative scoring for non-matching nucleotides
Gap open score parameter determines penalty for initiating a gap in the alignment
Gap extension score parameter determines penalty for continuing an existing gap
Minimum size parameter (Iterative Local only) specifies smallest subregion to analyze
Minimum score parameter (Iterative Local only) specifies lowest acceptable alignment score
GlobalAlignment is a computational biology module for performing pairwise DNA sequence alignments using dynamic programming algorithms.
The GlobalAlignment module implements three distinct dynamic programming alignment strategies: global (Needleman-Wunsch), local (Smith-Waterman), and iterative local alignment.
The module uses standard affine scoring parameters including match, mismatch, gap opening, and gap extension scores to evaluate sequence similarity.
Input sequences for GlobalAlignment must be provided as separate single-record FASTA files containing valid DNA characters (A, T, G, C, N), with case-insensitive processing.
The GlobalAlignment module only considers forward orientation alignments and does not perform reverse complement searching.
The iterative local alignment approach in GlobalAlignment finds non-overlapping local alignments through a greedy, recursive process of identifying and excluding high-scoring regions.
For meaningful alignment results in GlobalAlignment, the scoring parameters should follow specific constraints: gap opening cost should be less than gap extension cost.
The GlobalAlignment module supports flexible scoring parameters, allowing researchers to customize match, mismatch, and gap penalties for different alignment scenarios.
GlobalAlignment is implemented in Java and is platform-independent, capable of running on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine.
The module requires input of two FASTA files, along with numerical parameters for match, mismatch, gap opening, and gap extension scores.
Output from the GlobalAlignment module is a text file containing detailed information about the computed sequence alignments.
