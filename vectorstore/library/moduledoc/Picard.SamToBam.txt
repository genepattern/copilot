Picard.SamToBam is on version 2.
A description of Picard.SamToBam is Converts a SAM file to a BAM file. This module implements the SamFormatConverter function from Picard. SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) file format is a generic nucleotide alignment format that describes the alignment of query sequences or sequencing reads to a reference sequence or assembly. BAM is the binary version of the SAM format..
Picard.SamToBam is a GenePattern module written by Picard Tools.
Picard.SamToBam can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
