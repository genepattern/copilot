SubMap is on version .
A description of SubMap is Maps subclasses between two data sets. It searches for matching pairs of subclasses between two independent microarray data sets using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The mapping result is represented as a subclass association (SA) matrix filled with p-values for each subclass association..
SubMap is a GenePattern module written by Yujin Hoshida (Broad Institute).
SubMap can be categorized as Clustering, Microarray Analysis.
SubMap has the following parameters: datasetA, datasetB, classA, classB, num marker genes, num perm, num perm fisher, weighted score type, null distribution, p value correction, cluster rows, cluster columns, nominal p value matrix, create legend, random seed, output filename.
The SubMap module in GenePattern is a powerful tool for comparing and mapping subclasses between two independent microarray datasets.
SubMap helps researchers identify common subtypes across different gene expression studies by comparing subclass characteristics.
The SubMap module uses Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to measure similarity between subclasses from different datasets.
SubMap generates a subclass association (SA) matrix that represents the statistical relationships between subclasses from two different datasets.
By clustering the SA matrix, researchers can visualize the global structure and correspondence of subclasses observed across different studies.
SubMap is particularly useful for integrating microarray data from independent studies that may have different experimental platforms or conditions.
The module requires input datasets with common gene identifiers and corresponding class label files to perform subclass mapping.
SubMap can handle various types of subclass information, including those derived from unsupervised clustering or clinical phenotypes.
The module provides flexibility in statistical analysis through parameters like number of marker genes, permutations, and p-value correction methods.
SubMap generates multiple output files, including a summary of results, SA matrices, and heatmap visualizations of subclass associations.
The default settings in SubMap use a relatively large number of permutations to compute more accurate p-values compared to the SubMapBrowser module.
Researchers can use SubMap to identify potential common subtypes across different disease datasets, facilitating cross-study comparisons.
The module is particularly valuable in cancer research, where identifying consistent molecular subtypes across different patient cohorts is crucial.
SubMap helps overcome challenges in combining microarray datasets by providing a statistically robust method for subclass comparison.
The module's output can help researchers understand the underlying biological similarities and differences between different gene expression studies.
