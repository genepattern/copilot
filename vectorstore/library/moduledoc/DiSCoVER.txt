DiSCoVER is on version 1.0.
A description of DiSCoVER is A Python implementation of DiSCoVER, intended to be used for drug recommendation based on RNA-seq expression (e.g., the results from Kallisto)..
DiSCoVER is a GenePattern module written by Edwin Juarez.
DiSCoVER can be categorized as Drug Recommendation, RNA-seq, Bioinformatics.
DiSCoVER has the following parameters: gene_expression, select_control, control.
The DiSCoVER GenePattern module is a computational tool for recommending potential therapeutic drugs based on RNA-seq gene expression data.
DiSCoVER enables researchers to analyze gene expression profiles and identify novel drug treatment strategies for rare or complex tumors.
The module can process gene expression data in two specific CSV formats: a "wide" format from Kallisto and a "tall" format with three columns of gene expression information.
DiSCoVER allows users to select different control gene expression datasets, including custom controls, cerebellar stem cells, or neural stem cells for comparative analysis.
The module is implemented in Python 3.7 and can run on any operating system, making it widely accessible to researchers across different computational environments.
DiSCoVER uses computational modeling to match gene expression patterns with potential drug treatments, helping researchers discover innovative therapeutic approaches.
The module is particularly useful for studying rare tumors where traditional drug discovery methods might be challenging or limited.
DiSCoVER integrates computational analysis with genetic data to provide personalized drug recommendation insights for complex medical conditions.
The GenePattern implementation of DiSCoVER makes advanced drug recommendation algorithms more accessible to researchers without extensive computational expertise.
DiSCoVER can help researchers explore potential targeted therapies by comparing gene expression profiles against known drug-gene interaction databases.
DiSCoVER module gene_expression parameter is a string representing the CSV file containing gene expression data, which is required for the analysis.
DiSCoVER module select_control parameter is a string specifying the control type, with options 'Custom', 'Cerebellar stem cell', or 'Neural stem cell', defaulting to 'Custom'.
DiSCoVER module control parameter is a string representing the CSV file with control gene expression data, which is required when 'Custom' is selected as the control type, with a default empty string.
DiSCoVER module requires gene expression files in two acceptable CSV formats: "Wide" format with two rows and multiple columns, or "Tall" format with three columns and multiple rows.
DiSCoVER module supports gene expression data analysis for drug recommendation based on RNA-seq expression results.
DiSCoVER module can use predefined control types or allow custom control gene expression data input.
DiSCoVER module is compatible with Python 3.7 and can run on any operating system and CPU type.
DiSCoVER module input and output file descriptions:
Gene expression input file (CSV) is a tabular dataset containing gene names and their quantified expression levels
DiSCoVER module requires gene expression data in either "wide" or "tall" CSV format with specific column structures
Input gene expression file can be generated from RNA-seq quantification tools like Kallisto
Control gene expression input file follows the same CSV format as the primary gene expression file
DiSCoVER module allows selection of predefined control datasets like Cerebellar stem cell or Neural stem cell
Input CSV files must have consistent column structures with gene names and expression quantification
Gene expression input files should represent normalized or processed RNA-seq expression measurements
DiSCoVER module expects precise CSV formatting with specific row and column arrangements
Input files can be manually created or generated from computational RNA-seq analysis pipelines
CSV input files for DiSCoVER should contain numerical expression values for accurate drug recommendation analysis
