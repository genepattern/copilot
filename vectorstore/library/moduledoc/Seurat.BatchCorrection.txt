Seurat.BatchCorrection is on version 3.
A description of Seurat.BatchCorrection is The Seurat.BatchCorrection Module integrates (corrects for batch effects) multiple single-cell datasets and identifies shared cell states that are present across different datasets, regardless of their origin. Once the Module integrates these datasets, the returned object will contain a new Assay that holds an integrated/batch-corrected expression matrix for all cells..
Seurat.BatchCorrection is a GenePattern module written by Jonathan Zamora and Edwin F. Ju√°rez, UCSD.

Seurat.BatchCorrection module input files are gene expression matrices in .txt, .rds, or 10x Genomics format.
Input files must have columns representing cell IDs and rows representing genes.
Input files can be single-cell RNA sequencing data from multiple batches or experiments.
Input files should be preprocessed using Seurat.QC module if in compressed or 10x Genomics format.
Seurat.BatchCorrection module supports multiple input files representing different biological conditions or experimental batches.
Seurat.BatchCorrection module requires input files to be compatible with single-cell RNA sequencing data standards.
Seurat.BatchCorrection module produces a batch_correction_log.txt file documenting script execution processes.
Output .rds file contains integrated and batch-corrected expression matrix for all input cells.
Output .pdf file includes UMAP plot and violin plots of integrated Seurat objects.
Output .pdf file first page displays a batch mapping table showing input file to batch number correspondence.
Output files are named based on the output_file_name parameter specified during module execution.
Output files provide comprehensive visualization and data integration results from batch correction process.
Seurat.BatchCorrection is a GenePattern module for integrating multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.
The module uses Seurat version 3.2.0 to correct batch effects across different single-cell gene expression experiments.
Batch correction helps identify shared cell states across datasets by mathematically aligning gene expression profiles from different experimental batches.
The module requires input files containing gene expression matrices, which can be in .txt or .rds format, representing different experimental batches.
Users can control the batch correction process by specifying the number of principal components (ncomps) used in the analysis, with a default of 50 components.
The module generates three key output files: a log file, an integrated Seurat object (.rds), and a visualization PDF showing UMAP plots and batch mapping.
Violin plots can be generated to show the distribution of molecular and gene counts across cells, which helps assess data quality and integration effectiveness.
The batch correction algorithm aims to mathematically align cellular transcriptional states across different experiments, reducing technical variability.
The module is implemented in R 4.0.2 and runs within a specific Docker container designed for single-cell data processing.
The underlying scientific method is based on the comprehensive single-cell data integration approach published by Stuart et al. in Cell, 2019.
