ImputeMissingValuesKNN is on version .
A description of ImputeMissingValuesKNN is Imputes missing data for each gene with missing values by finding k nearest neighbors using a Euclidean metric. For genes with missing values, it identifies k nearest neighbors based on non-missing coordinates, and imputes missing elements by averaging non-missing elements of neighbors. If all neighbors are missing for an element, it uses the overall column mean..
ImputeMissingValuesKNN is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN can be categorized as Missing Value Imputation.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN has the following parameters: data.filename, k, rowmax, colmax, output.file.
The ImputeMissingValuesKNN module is a computational tool for handling missing data in gene expression datasets.
The ImputeMissingValuesKNN module uses k-nearest neighbors to estimate missing values in biological datasets.
In gene expression research, missing data can occur due to technical limitations, experimental errors, or measurement challenges.
The ImputeMissingValuesKNN module finds similar genes (neighbors) based on their existing data points to estimate missing values.
The module uses Euclidean distance as a metric to determine which genes are most similar when imputing missing data.
When imputing missing values, the ImputeMissingValuesKNN module looks at the k most similar genes and averages their non-missing values.
If all neighboring genes have missing values for a specific data point, the ImputeMissingValuesKNN module uses the overall column mean.
The module allows researchers to set parameters like the number of neighbors (k) and maximum percentage of missing data allowed in rows and columns.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN is particularly useful in microarray and RNA-seq data analysis where complete datasets are crucial for downstream statistical analyses.
The module helps maintain data integrity by providing a systematic approach to handling incomplete biological datasets.
Researchers can use ImputeMissingValuesKNN to prepare gene expression data for further computational and statistical investigations.
The module is compatible with GenePattern's computational environment and can be integrated into larger bioinformatics workflows.
data.filename: String type parameter in ImputeMissingValuesKNN module representing the input data file containing missing values stored as NA in .gct format.
data.filename: Required parameter specifying the source of gene expression data to be processed for missing value imputation.
k: Integer parameter in ImputeMissingValuesKNN module defining the number of nearest neighbors used during imputation process.
k: Required parameter controlling the neighborhood size for calculating missing value estimates.
rowmax: Numeric parameter in ImputeMissingValuesKNN module setting the maximum percentage of missing data allowed in any single row.
rowmax: Controls row-level data filtering by specifying a threshold for acceptable missing data percentage.
colmax: Numeric parameter in ImputeMissingValuesKNN module setting the maximum percentage of missing data allowed in any single column.
colmax: Controls column-level data filtering by specifying a threshold for acceptable missing data percentage.
output.file: String type parameter in ImputeMissingValuesKNN module specifying the name of the output file in .gct format.
output.file: Required parameter defining the destination for the imputed gene expression data after processing.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN module input data file is a .gct format gene expression matrix with missing values represented as NA.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN module requires a numeric input file containing gene expression measurements across multiple samples.
The input .gct file for ImputeMissingValuesKNN contains gene identifiers in the first column and sample/condition identifiers in the first row.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN input file must have missing values represented as NA or blank cells in the gene expression matrix.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN output file is a .gct format gene expression matrix with missing values imputed using k-nearest neighbors method.
The output .gct file from ImputeMissingValuesKNN contains the same gene and sample identifiers as the input file, with missing values replaced.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN output file preserves the original matrix structure while filling in missing values through nearest neighbor averaging.
The output file from ImputeMissingValuesKNN includes imputed values calculated based on the k-nearest neighbors specified in the module parameters.
ImputeMissingValuesKNN generates a complete gene expression matrix where missing values are estimated using neighboring gene expression profiles.
The ImputeMissingValuesKNN module is a computational method for handling missing data in gene expression datasets.
The module uses a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach to estimate missing values in a gene expression matrix.
For each gene with missing values, the module finds k most similar genes based on Euclidean distance across available data points.
The KNN imputation method calculates distances only using coordinates where the target gene is not missing.
When calculating neighbor distances, the module can handle partially missing neighbor data by averaging distances from non-missing coordinates.
Missing values are imputed by taking the average of non-missing values from the k nearest neighbor genes.
If all neighbors are missing for a specific data point, the module uses the overall column mean for that gene block.
The module requires a GCT file as input, which represents a gene expression matrix with missing values denoted as NA.
Users can specify the number of neighbors (k) to use in the imputation process, controlling the similarity-based estimation.
The module allows setting maximum thresholds for missing data in rows and columns to filter out genes or samples with excessive missing information.
The output is a new GCT file with missing values replaced by estimated values based on the KNN algorithm.
This imputation method helps maintain the overall statistical properties of the gene expression dataset while filling in missing data points.
The algorithm is implemented in R and can run on any computational platform with R installed.
The method is based on statistical techniques developed by researchers like Hastie, Tibshirani, and colleagues in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
