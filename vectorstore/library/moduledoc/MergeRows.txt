MergeRows is on version .
A description of MergeRows is Creates a new merged dataset from a list of datasets. Common columns in the datasets are retained while others are discarded..
MergeRows is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
MergeRows can be categorized as Preprocess & Utilities.
MergeRows has the following parameters: input filename1, input filename2, zip filename, output.
The MergeRows GenePattern module allows researchers to combine multiple datasets by combining their rows.
MergeRows is useful for consolidating data from multiple experimental sources or replicates into a single comprehensive dataset.
The MergeRows module can handle multiple file formats including .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, and .cls files.
When merging datasets, MergeRows retains common columns across input files and discards unique columns.
If input files have different formats, the MergeRows module will output the merged data in .gct format by default.
MergeRows is a preprocessing utility that helps researchers standardize and combine genomic, transcriptomic, or other biological datasets.
The module can merge two files directly or accept a zip file containing multiple files for merging.
MergeRows is platform-independent and can run on any operating system with Java support.
Researchers in fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and systems biology frequently use MergeRows to consolidate experimental data.
The MergeRows module simplifies data integration by automatically handling column matching and format conversion.
input: filename1, string, first file to merge in MergeRows module, required, supports .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, .cls formats
input: filename2, string, second file to merge in MergeRows module, required, supports .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, .cls formats
input: zip, filename, zip file containing files to merge in MergeRows module, optional alternative to individual file inputs
output, string, name of the merged file produced by MergeRows module, required
MergeRows module combines datasets by row, retaining common columns and discarding unique columns
MergeRows output file format matches input file formats, defaulting to .gct if input formats differ
MergeRows supports multiple file types for merging, providing flexibility in data preprocessing
MergeRows module enables researchers to consolidate datasets with shared column structures
MergeRows preserves data integrity by maintaining common column information during merging
MergeRows module requires input files in .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, or .cls file formats.
First input file for MergeRows module contains original dataset rows to be merged.
Second input file for MergeRows module contains additional dataset rows to combine with first input.
Zip file input for MergeRows module can contain multiple files to merge instead of individual file inputs.
MergeRows module output file retains common columns from input datasets.
MergeRows module output file format matches input file format, defaulting to .gct if input formats differ.
MergeRows module preserves row data from both input files in merged output.
MergeRows module discards columns not common to all input datasets.
MergeRows module generates a single merged dataset file as output.
MergeRows module supports merging datasets with consistent column structures.
MergeRows module allows combining multiple datasets by merging their rows into a single comprehensive dataset.
MergeRows supports merging files with various genomic data formats like .res, .gct, .snp, .cn, .xcn, .odf, and .cls.
The MergeRows module retains common columns across input datasets while discarding unique columns.
MergeRows can merge datasets using either direct file inputs or a zip file containing multiple files.
The output of MergeRows maintains the format of the input files, defaulting to .gct format if input formats differ.
MergeRows is a preprocessing utility module designed to work across different computational platforms.
The module is implemented in Java and can run on any operating system and CPU architecture.
MergeRows is developed by Joshua Gould from the Broad Institute, supporting genomic data integration workflows.
When using MergeRows, users must specify input files, an optional zip file, and a desired output filename.
The MergeRows module enables researchers to consolidate multiple genomic datasets efficiently and systematically.
