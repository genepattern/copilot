Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is on version .
A description of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables (regression) and categorical predictor variables (classification) (Breiman, et al., 1984). It works by recursively splitting the feature space into a set of non-overlapping regions (rectangles in the case of continuous features; subsets of values, in the case of categorical features), and by then predicting the most likely value of the dependent variable within each region..
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a GenePattern module written by Joshua Gould, gp-help@broad.mit.edu.
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) can be categorized as Prediction.
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) has the following parameters: train.data.filename, train.cls.filename, saved.model.filename, model.output.file, test.data.filename, test.cls.filename, pred.results.file, tree.output.file.
The CART GenePattern module is a powerful tool for building predictive models using decision tree algorithms in bioinformatics.
CART can create classification trees to predict categorical outcomes based on multiple input features.
CART can create regression trees to predict continuous numerical outcomes from complex datasets.
The CART module allows researchers to recursively split feature spaces into non-overlapping regions for predictive modeling.
CART can handle missing values in biological datasets, making it robust for real-world genomic and molecular data analysis.
The module supports training models on one dataset and testing them on separate validation datasets.
CART generates visual decision tree plots that help researchers understand the logical decision pathways in their predictive models.
The module can save trained models for subsequent reuse on additional test datasets in bioinformatics research.
CART is particularly useful for analyzing complex biological relationships where linear models might not capture intricate interactions.
The module supports both .gct and .res file formats, common in genomic and transcriptomic data analysis.
CART can predict outcomes in scenarios like disease classification, gene expression patterns, or molecular trait prediction.
The algorithm works by creating nested logical conditions that segment data into predictive subgroups based on input features.
Researchers can use CART to identify key features that most strongly influence a particular biological outcome or classification.
The module provides flexibility in model creation, allowing training, testing, or combined train/test workflows.
CART's decision tree approach makes complex predictive models more interpretable compared to black-box machine learning techniques.
