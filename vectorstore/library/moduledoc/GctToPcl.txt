GctToPcl is on version 1.0.
A description of GctToPcl is Converts files in GenePattern's gct format to Stanford's pcl format. The pcl and gct file formats are very similar. The key difference is that pcl files support 'weights', while gct files are unweighted. The conversion from gct to pcl sets all weight values in the resulting pcl file to 1..
GctToPcl is a GenePattern module written by Jeremy Hubble (Stanford).
GctToPcl can be categorized as Data Format Conversion.
GctToPcl has the following parameters: input.filename, output.filename.
The GctToPcl module is a specialized data format conversion tool in the GenePattern bioinformatics platform for transforming genetic expression data files.
The GctToPcl module converts genetic expression data from GenePattern's .gct file format to Stanford's .pcl file format.
The primary difference between .gct and .pcl formats is the support for 'weights' in .pcl files, which are set to 1 during conversion.
GctToPcl is useful for researchers who need to standardize genetic expression data files across different bioinformatics platforms and analysis tools.
The module is platform-independent and can run on any operating system with a Perl interpreter.
GctToPcl is part of a broader set of file conversion tools in GenePattern, complemented by the PclToGct module for reverse conversions.
Researchers in genomics, transcriptomics, and computational biology can use GctToPcl to prepare data for downstream analysis and visualization.
The module preserves the core genetic expression data during format conversion, ensuring data integrity and compatibility.
GctToPcl supports researchers working with gene expression microarray and RNA-seq datasets by facilitating file format interoperability.
The module is designed to be simple to use, requiring only input and output filename parameters for successful conversion.
input.filename: string, source GCT file to convert to PCL format, required, no default value
input.filename: specifies the input file in GenePattern's gct format for the GctToPcl module
input.filename: contains the path and filename of the original genetic data file to be transformed
output.filename: string, name of PCL file to output, required, no default value
output.filename: defines the destination filename for the converted PCL format file
output.filename: determines where the transformed genetic data will be saved after conversion
GctToPcl module converts genetic data files between two similar but distinct file formats
GctToPcl handles transformation from GenePattern's gct format to Stanford's pcl format
GctToPcl sets all weight values in the resulting PCL file to 1 during conversion
GctToPcl preserves the core genetic data structure while adapting to PCL file specifications
Conversion process ensures data integrity and compatibility between different genetic data representations
Conversion supports researchers working with genetic data across different computational platforms
Conversion maintains the essential genetic information while adapting file format requirements
GctToPcl module converts input GCT file to PCL file format
Input file is a GCT format file containing gene expression data
Input GCT file includes gene names, sample identifiers, and expression measurements
Input file typically has a header with file version and dimension information
GctToPcl module requires a source GCT file as primary input
Output file is a PCL format file with gene expression data
Output PCL file includes gene names, sample identifiers, and expression measurements
Output PCL file sets all weight values to 1 during conversion
Output filename is specified by user parameter
PCL file format supports additional 'weights' column not present in GCT format
Conversion preserves gene and sample identifiers across file formats
GctToPcl module performs lossless data transformation between file formats
Input and output files contain numerical gene expression data
File conversion supports standardization of gene expression data representations
GctToPcl module converts GenePattern's gct file format to Stanford's pcl file format
The GctToPcl module is designed to transform genetic data files between two similar but distinct formats
GctToPcl sets all weight values in the resulting pcl file to 1 during conversion
The key difference between gct and pcl formats is that pcl files support 'weights' while gct files are unweighted
GctToPcl requires an input gct filename and generates an output pcl filename
The module was authored by Jeremy Hubble from Stanford and released in September 2008
GctToPcl is a data format conversion task that can run on any CPU or operating system
The conversion process is implemented in Perl and does not have specific Java JVM requirements
Users can reverse the conversion process using the complementary PclToGct module
The module references Stanford's pcl file format documentation and Broad's GCT file format specifications
GctToPcl preserves the core genetic data structure while adding a uniform weight of 1 to the converted file
