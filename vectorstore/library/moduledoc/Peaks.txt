Peaks is on version .
A description of Peaks is Performs peak detection using digital convolution (moving-window) filters. The input spectrum is subjected to the following filters (in sequence): smoothing (low-pass) filter, adaptive background correction (unsharp masking) filter, and high-pass filter. The function returns a table with the original spectrum and the result of applying the filters..

Peaks module is a computational tool for detecting spectral peaks in mass spectrometry data using digital filtering techniques.
Peaks module applies a sequence of digital filters to process spectral data for identifying significant signal peaks.
The Peaks module uses three primary digital filters: a smoothing (low-pass) filter, an adaptive background correction filter, and a high-pass filter.
Peaks module requires a spectrum data file in CSV format as input, with parameters to define mass-to-charge (M/Z) range and filtering characteristics.
The smoothing filter in the Peaks module reduces noise by averaging signal intensities over a specified window size, typically 21 data points.
Adaptive background correction in the Peaks module uses an unsharp masking technique to enhance local signal variations against background noise.
The high-pass filter in the Peaks module emphasizes high-frequency signal components, helping to isolate potential peak regions.
Peaks module allows users to set a percentile threshold (default 0.65) to determine which filtered signal regions are considered significant peaks.
The output of the Peaks module is an ODF file containing the original spectrum data and the filtered, peak-detected spectrum.
Peaks module is implemented in R and is platform-independent, making it versatile for proteomics data analysis across different computational environments.
The module was developed by D. R. Mani at the Broad Institute, with applications in medical diagnosis and biomarker discovery.
